This section will detail all the needed information to create a custom node in Flojoy. During your development, remember that your custom nodes are just functions in Python, and so you can import whatever you should need. The _de facto_ libraries for numeric and scientific processing in Python, `NumPy` and `SciPy`, as well as others such as `OpenCV` are installed by default with Flojoy.
