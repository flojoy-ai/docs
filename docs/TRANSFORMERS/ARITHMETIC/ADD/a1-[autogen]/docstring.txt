Add 2 or more numeric arrays, matrices, dataframes, or constants element-wise.
    When a constant is added to an array or matrix, each element in the array or
    matrix will be increased by the constant value. If 2 arrays or matrices of different
    sizes are added, the output will be the size of the larger array or matrix with
    only the overlapping elements changed.
