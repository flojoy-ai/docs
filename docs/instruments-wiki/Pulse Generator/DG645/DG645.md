title: DG645
description: The DG645 is a versatile digital delay/pulse generator that provides precisely defined pulses at repetition rates up to 10 MHz. The instrument offers several improvements over older designs—lower jitter, higher accuracy, faster trigger rates, and more outputs. The DG645 also has Ethernet, GPIB and RS-232 interfaces for computer or network control of the instrument.

## Connect to the DG645 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Instrumentkit" label="Instrumentkit">

Here's an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a DG645 Pulse Generator:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the DG645 Pulse Generator
dg645 = ik.dg645.DG645.open_gpib('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Set the pulse width to 10 ns
dg645.pulse_width = 10 * ik.units.ns

# Set the delay to 1 us
dg645.delay = 1 * ik.units.us

# Set the trigger level to 2 V
dg645.trigger_level = 2 * ik.units.V

# Enable the output
dg645.output_enabled = True

# Close the connection
dg645.close()
```

Note: This code assumes that you have already installed the Instrumentkit library and its dependencies.
