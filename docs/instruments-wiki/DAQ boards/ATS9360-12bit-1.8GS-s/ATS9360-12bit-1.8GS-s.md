```

This script connects to the ATS9360 DAQ board using the `AlazarTech_ATS9360` driver from Qcodes. It then configures various settings such as clock source, sample rate, trigger settings, and acquisition parameters. After starting the acquisition, it reads the acquired data and stops the acquisition. Finally, it disconnects from the DAQ board.

Note: This script assumes that you have already installed the necessary dependencies, including Qcodes and the AlazarTech driver for the ATS9360 board.
