## Connect to the AMI 430 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Qcodes" label="Qcodes">

To connect to an AMI 430 Power Supply using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.american_magnetics.AMI430 import AMI430

# Create an instance of the AMI430 instrument
ami430 = AMI430("ami430", "TCPIP::192.168.1.1::7180::SOCKET")

# Connect to the instrument
ami430.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to control the power supply
# For example, you can set the field to a specific value
ami430.field(0.5)  # Set the field to 0.5 Tesla

# You can also read the current field value
field = ami430.field()
print("Current field:", field)

# When you are done, remember to disconnect from the instrument
ami430.disconnect()
```

Make sure to replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::7180::SOCKET"` with the actual IP address and port of your AMI 430 Power Supply.
