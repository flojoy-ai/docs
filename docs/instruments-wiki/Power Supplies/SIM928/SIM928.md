title: SIM928
description: The SIM928 Isolated Voltage Source is ideal for applications where ultra-clean DC voltage is required. Voltage can be set between ±20 VDC with millivolt resolution, and the source can drive up to ±10 mA. The output circuit is optically isolated from all earth-referenced charging circuitry, providing maximum flexibility and noise immunity. The system can float to ±40 V, and the output is short-circuit protected.
