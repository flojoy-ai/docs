## Connect to the HMC 8043 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="QCodes Community" label="QCodes Community">

To connect to a Rohde & Schwarz HMC8043 Power Supply using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMC8043 import RohdeSchwarzHMC8043

# Create an instance of the RohdeSchwarzHMC8043 driver
power_supply = RohdeSchwarzHMC8043('power_supply', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the power supply
power_supply.connect()

# Now you can use the power_supply object to control the power supply
# For example, you can set the voltage of channel 1 to 5V
power_supply.ch1.voltage.set(5)

# Disconnect from the power supply
power_supply.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your power supply.
