## Connect to the QL335-P in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Qcodes" label="Qcodes">

To connect to a QL335-P Power Supply using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.visa import VisaInstrument
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.aimtti.AimTTi import AimTTi

# Create an instance of the AimTTi instrument
aim_tti = AimTTi("aim_tti", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
aim_tti.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform operations
# For example, to get the voltage of channel 1
voltage = aim_tti.ch1.volt.get()

# You can also set the voltage of channel 1
aim_tti.ch1.volt.set(2.5)

# Disconnect from the instrument
aim_tti.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `"TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR"` with the actual VISA resource address of your QL335-P Power Supply.
