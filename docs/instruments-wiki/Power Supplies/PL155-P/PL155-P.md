## Connect to the PL155-P in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Qcodes" label="Qcodes">

Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a PL155-P Power Supply:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.visa import VisaInstrument
from qcodes.instrument.channel import ChannelList

class AimTTiChannel(VisaInstrument):
    # Define the parameters and methods for the channel

class AimTTi(VisaInstrument):
    # Define the parameters and methods for the power supply

# Create an instance of the power supply
power_supply = AimTTi('power_supply', 'TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Print the identification of the power supply
print(power_supply.get_idn())

# Access the channels of the power supply
channels = power_supply.channels

# Print the voltage of channel 1
print(channels.ch1.volt())

# Set the voltage of channel 1 to 5V
channels.ch1.volt(5)

# Close the connection to the power supply
power_supply.close()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual VISA resource address of your PL155-P Power Supply.
