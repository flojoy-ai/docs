## Connect to the IPS 120 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Qcodes Community" label="Qcodes Community">

To connect to an IPS 120 Power Supply using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.oxford.OxfordInstruments_IPS120 import OxfordInstruments_IPS120

# Create an instance of the IPS 120 Power Supply
ips = OxfordInstruments_IPS120('ips', 'COM1', use_gpib=False, number=2)

# Connect to the IPS 120 Power Supply
ips.connect()

# Perform operations with the IPS 120 Power Supply
# For example, get the current setpoint
current_setpoint = ips.current_setpoint()

# Print the current setpoint
print(f"Current Setpoint: {current_setpoint} A")

# Disconnect from the IPS 120 Power Supply
ips.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'COM1'` with the appropriate address of the IPS 120 Power Supply.
