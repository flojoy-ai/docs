description: The PRO8000 Chassis can accept up to 8 modules and is ideally suited for the needs of large test setups. This made-to-order chassis can be custom configured with up to eight modules that best meet individual experimental needs prior to purchase. The chassis can also be ordered empty, without any pre-installed modules. The empty slots of the PRO8000 can be covered using PRO8000-C front cover plates.

The code defines a class `ThorlabsPro8000` that represents the Thorlabs Pro 8000 modular laser driver. It inherits from the `Instrument` class provided by the `pymeasure.instruments` module.

The class has several class-level variables defined:
- `SLOTS` is a range from 1 to 8, representing the available slots in the laser driver.
- `LDC_POLARITIES` is a list of allowed laser diode polarities, which can be either 'AG' or 'CG'.
- `STATUS` is a list of allowed status values, which can be either 'ON' or 'OFF'.

The `__init__` method initializes the instrument by calling the `Instrument` class's `__init__` method and setting the name of the instrument to "Thorlabs Pro 8000". It also writes the command `':SYST:ANSW VALUE'` to the instrument.

The class defines several instrument controls using the `Instrument.control` decorator. Each control corresponds to a specific command that can be sent to the instrument.

- `slot` control is used to control the slot selection. It reads the current slot with the command `:SLOT?` and sets the slot with the command `:SLOT %d`. The allowed values for the slot are specified as `SLOTS`, and the `strict_discrete_set` validator is used to ensure that only valid values are used.

- `LDCCurrent` control is used to control the laser current. It reads the current laser current with the command `:ILD:SET?` and sets the laser current with the command `:ILD:SET %g`.

- `LDCCurrentLimit` control is used to set the software current limit. It reads the current software current limit with the command `:LIMC:SET?` and sets the software current limit with the command `:LIMC:SET %g`.

- `LDCPolarity` control is used to set the laser diode polarity. It reads the current laser diode polarity with the command `:LIMC:SET?` and sets the laser diode polarity with the command `:LIMC:SET %s`. The allowed values for the polarity are specified as `LDC_POLARITIES`, and the `strict_discrete_set` validator is used to ensure that only valid values are used.

- `LDCStatus` control is used to set the laser diode status. It reads the current laser diode status with the command `:LASER?` and sets the laser diode status with the command `:LASER %s`. The allowed values for the status are specified as `STATUS`, and the `strict_discrete_set` validator is used to ensure that only valid values are used.

- `TEDStatus` control is used to control the TEC status. It reads the current TEC status with the command `:TEC?` and sets the TEC status with the command `:TEC %s`. The allowed values for the status are specified as `STATUS`, and the `strict_discrete_set` validator is used to ensure that only valid values are used.

- `TEDSetTemperature` control is used to control the TEC temperature. It reads the current TEC temperature with the command `:TEMP:SET?` and sets the TEC temperature with the command `:TEMP:SET %g`.
