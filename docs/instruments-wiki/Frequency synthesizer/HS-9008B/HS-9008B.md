## Connect to the HS 9008B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)

<TabItem value="Instrumentkit" label="Instrumentkit">

To connect to a HS 9008B Frequency synthesizer using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the HS 9008B Frequency synthesizer
hs = ik.holzworth.HS9000.open_tcpip("192.168.0.2", 8080)

# Access the channels on the HS 9008B
channel_1 = hs.channel[0]
channel_2 = hs.channel[1]

# Get the frequency of channel 1
frequency_1 = channel_1.frequency
print(f"Frequency of channel 1: {frequency_1}")

# Set the frequency of channel 2 to 1 GHz
channel_2.frequency = 1 * ik.units.GHz

# Get the power of channel 2
power_2 = channel_2.power
print(f"Power of channel 2: {power_2}")

# Turn on the output of channel 1
channel_1.output = True

# Check if the HS 9008B is ready
is_ready = hs.ready
print(f"Is HS 9008B ready: {is_ready}")
```

This script connects to the HS 9008B Frequency synthesizer at IP address "192.168.0.2" and port 8080. It then accesses the channels on the synthesizer and performs various operations such as getting and setting the frequency and power of the channels, and turning on the output of a channel. Finally, it checks if the synthesizer is ready for operation.
