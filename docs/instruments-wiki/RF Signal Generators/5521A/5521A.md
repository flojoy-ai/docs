## Connect to the 5521A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="QCodes Community" label="QCodes Community">

Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a 5521A RF Signal Generator:

```python
from qcodes import Station, Instrument
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.SignalCore.SC5521A import SC5521A

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the RF Signal Generator
signal_generator = SC5521A('signal_generator', dll_path='SignalCore\\SC5520A\\api\\c\\scipci\\x64\\sc5520a_uhfs.dll')
station.add_component(signal_generator)

# Access the parameters and methods of the RF Signal Generator
print(signal_generator.temperature())
print(signal_generator.status())
signal_generator.status('on')
print(signal_generator.status())
print(signal_generator.power())
signal_generator.power(-10)
print(signal_generator.power())
print(signal_generator.frequency())
signal_generator.frequency(1e9)
print(signal_generator.frequency())

# Close the connection to the RF Signal Generator
signal_generator.close()
```

Note: Make sure to replace the `dll_path` argument with the correct path to the instrument DLL on your system.
