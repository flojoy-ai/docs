## Connect to the AWG70002B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)

<TabItem value="QCodes" label="QCodes">

To connect to a AWG70002B RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.AWG70000A import AWG70000A

# Create an instance of the AWG70000A instrument
awg = AWG70000A('awg', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
awg.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform various operations
# For example, you can set the amplitude of channel 1 to 0.5 V
awg.ch1.awg_amplitude(0.5)

# You can also play a waveform or sequence
awg.play()

# When you are done, remember to disconnect from the instrument
awg.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA resource name of your AWG70002B RF Signal Generator.
