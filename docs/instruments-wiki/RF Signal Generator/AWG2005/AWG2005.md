title: AWG2005
description: The AWG2005 offers 20 MS/s and 64 k deep memory. As with the entire AWG2000 Series, the graphical user interface allows on-screen viewing of waveform editing, simplifying "what if" test scenarios by allowing the easy creation of composite signals. The standard AWG2005 configuration provides two independent 10 V outputs or a third and fourth 10 V output (Option 02) each with 12-Bits vertical resolution. Option 04 adds TTL digital levels with (2) 12-Bit, 100 MS/s ports and combines with the marker outputs to provide a total of 28-Bits wide. The built-in sweep generator (Option 05) provides even more flexibility by offering linear and logarithmic swept frequencies, but even more significantly the AWG2005 has user definable sweep capability. This allows creation of digitally modulated signals at IF frequencies. The built-in frequency domain (FFT) editor (Option 09) is a perfect addition for customers performing proprietary or standard I & Q modulation simulations, filter design or in circuit testing of physical layer. Real time waveform sequencing extends the effective record length output to over a billion points! The AWG2005 easily simulates signals where moderate point definition and long records are required for simulating complex waveform conditions. Direct waveform transfer capability makes the AWG2005 the perfect complement to selected Tektronix oscilloscopes.

## Connect to the AWG2005 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Instrumentkit" label="Instrumentkit">

To connect to a AWG2005 RF Signal Generator using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the AWG2005 RF Signal Generator
awg = ik.tektronix.TekAWG2000.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 1)

# Access the desired channel
channel = awg.channel[0]

# Set the amplitude of the channel
channel.amplitude = 1.5  # Set amplitude to 1.5 V

# Set the frequency of the channel
channel.frequency = 1e6  # Set frequency to 1 MHz

# Set the waveform shape of the channel
channel.shape = awg.Shape.sine  # Set waveform shape to sine

# Disconnect from the AWG2005 RF Signal Generator
awg.close()
```

This script connects to the AWG2005 RF Signal Generator using the `open_gpibusb` method from the `TekAWG2000` class in the `tektronix` module of Instrumentkit. It then accesses the first channel of the AWG2005 using `awg.channel[0]`. The script sets the amplitude, frequency, and waveform shape of the channel using the properties `channel.amplitude`, `channel.frequency`, and `channel.shape` respectively. Finally, it closes the connection to the AWG2005 using `awg.close()`.
