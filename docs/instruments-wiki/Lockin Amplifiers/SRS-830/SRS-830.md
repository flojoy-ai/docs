## Connect to the SRS 830 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)

<TabItem value="Instrumentkit" label="Instrumentkit">

To connect to a SRS 830 Lock-In Amplifier using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the lock-in amplifier
srs = ik.srs.SRS830.open_gpibusb('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Set the lock-in frequency
srs.frequency = 1000 * ik.units.hertz

# Take a measurement with a sample rate of 1Hz and 10 samples
data = srs.take_measurement(1, 10)
```

This code imports the `instrumentkit` library and uses the `open_gpibusb` method from the `ik.srs.SRS830` module to connect to the lock-in amplifier. The `open_gpibusb` method takes the device path (`'/dev/ttyUSB0'`) and the GPIB address (`1`) as arguments.

Once connected, you can set the lock-in frequency using the `frequency` property of the `srs` object. In this example, the frequency is set to 1000 Hz.

Finally, you can use the `take_measurement` method of the `srs` object to take a measurement. This method takes the sample rate (1 Hz) and the number of samples (10) as arguments and returns the measurement data.
