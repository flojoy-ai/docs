## Connect to the SR860 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="QCodes" label="QCodes">

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.stanford_research.SR86x import SR860

# Create an instance of the SR860 lock-in amplifier
lockin = SR860('lockin', 'TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the lock-in amplifier
lockin.connect()

# Perform operations with the lock-in amplifier
# ...

# Disconnect from the lock-in amplifier
lockin.disconnect()
```

Explanation:
1. Import the `SR860` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.stanford_research.SR86x` module.
2. Create an instance of the `SR860` lock-in amplifier with the name `'lockin'` and the specified IP address `'TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR'`.
3. Connect to the lock-in amplifier using the `connect()` method.
4. Perform any desired operations with the lock-in amplifier.
5. Disconnect from the lock-in amplifier using the `disconnect()` method.
