## Connect to the Keysight 34460A Submodules in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Qcodes" label="Qcodes">

To connect to a Keysight 34460A Submodules Multimeter using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_344xxA import Keysight_34411A

# Create an instance of the Keysight_34411A driver
multimeter = Keysight_34411A(name='multimeter', address='your_device_address')

# Connect to the multimeter
multimeter.connect()

# Now you can use the multimeter to perform measurements
# For example, to measure the voltage:
voltage = multimeter.volt()

# Print the measured voltage
print(f"Measured voltage: {voltage} V")

# Disconnect from the multimeter
multimeter.disconnect()
```

Make sure to replace `'your_device_address'` with the actual address of your Keysight 34460A Submodules Multimeter.
