## Connect to the Keysight 34461A Submodules in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Qcodes" label="Qcodes">

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_344xxA import Keysight34461A

# Create an instance of the Keysight34461A driver
dmm = Keysight34461A('dmm', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
dmm.connect()

# Perform measurements or other operations with the instrument

# Disconnect from the instrument
dmm.disconnect()
```

This code imports the necessary modules and creates an instance of the `Keysight34461A` driver. It then connects to the instrument using the specified address (`TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR`). After performing any desired measurements or operations, it disconnects from the instrument.
