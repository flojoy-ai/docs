```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Tektronix_DPO7000xx import TektronixDPO7000xx

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = TektronixDPO7000xx("oscilloscope", "TCPIP::1.2.3.4::INSTR")

# Print the available channels
print(oscilloscope.channel)

# Set the time per division
oscilloscope.horizontal.scale(1e-6)

# Set the trigger type and source
oscilloscope.trigger.type("edge")
oscilloscope.trigger.source("CH1")

# Enable measurement statistics
oscilloscope.statistics.mode("ALL")

# Perform a measurement
voltage_measurement = oscilloscope.measurement.mean()

# Print the measurement result
print(voltage_measurement())

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```
This script connects to a Tektronix MSO70000 Oscilloscope using the QCoDeS driver. It sets the time per division, trigger type, and source. It enables measurement statistics and performs a voltage measurement. Finally, it prints the measurement result and disconnects from the oscilloscope.
