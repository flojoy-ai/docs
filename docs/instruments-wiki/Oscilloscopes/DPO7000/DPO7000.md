## Connect to the DPO7000 in Python

```python
from instrumentkit import Scope

# Connect to the oscilloscope
scope = Scope("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Set up the oscilloscope
scope.set_timebase(1e-6)  # Set timebase to 1us/div
scope.set_channel_scale(1, 0.1)  # Set channel 1 scale to 0.1V/div
scope.set_channel_scale(2, 0.2)  # Set channel 2 scale to 0.2V/div

# Acquire waveform data
waveform = scope.acquire_waveform(1)  # Acquire waveform from channel 1

# Print the acquired waveform data
print(waveform)

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
scope.disconnect()
```

In this script, we first import the `Scope` class from the `instrumentkit` module. Then, we create an instance of the `Scope` class by passing the instrument's address as a string to the constructor.

Next, we set up the oscilloscope by calling various methods on the `scope` object. For example, we use the `set_timebase` method to set the timebase to 1us/div and the `set_channel_scale` method to set the scale of channel 1 to 0.1V/div and channel 2 to 0.2V/div.

After setting up the oscilloscope, we can acquire waveform data using the `acquire_waveform` method. In this example, we acquire the waveform from channel 1 by passing `1` as an argument to the method.

Finally, we print the acquired waveform data and disconnect from the oscilloscope using the `disconnect` method.

Note: Replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your DPO7000 Oscilloscope.

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = TektronixDPO7000xx("oscilloscope", "TCPIP::1.2.3.4::INSTR")

# Print the available channels
print(oscilloscope.channel)

# Set the time per division to 1 ms for channel 1
oscilloscope.channel1.scale(0.001)

# Set the trigger type to edge and the source to channel 1
oscilloscope.trigger.A.type("edge")
oscilloscope.trigger.A.source("CH1")

# Enable the measurement for channel 1
oscilloscope.measurement1.state(1)

# Get the mean value of the measurement for channel 1
mean_value = oscilloscope.measurement1.mean()
print(f"Mean value: {mean_value}")

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```
Note: Replace "TCPIP::1.2.3.4::INSTR" with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your oscilloscope.
