title: SC10
description: The easy-to-read LCD front panel provides access to the same commands as the included LabVIEW and LabWindows software packages. In addition to simply opening or closing the shutter, a repeating sequence of open and close events with exposure times as low as 10 ms can be set up and initiated either by a front panel button, a TTL pulse (+5 V), or a computer command via RS-232. Alternatively, the shutter can be synchronized to follow the rising and falling edges of an external voltage supplied over BNC.

The easy-to-read LCD front panel provides access to the same commands as the included LabVIEW and LabWindows software packages. In addition to simply opening or closing the shutter, a repeating sequence of open and close events with exposure times as low as 10 ms can be set up and initiated either by a front panel button, a TTL pulse (+5 V), or a computer command via RS-232. Alternatively, the shutter can be synchronized to follow the rising and falling edges of an external voltage supplied over BNC.

## Connect to the SC10 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Instrumentkit" label="Instrumentkit">

Here is an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a SC10 Shutter Controller:

```python
from instrumentkit import SC10

# Connect to the SC10 Shutter Controller
shutter_controller = SC10("COM1")

# Open the shutter
shutter_controller.open_shutter()

# Close the shutter
shutter_controller.close_shutter()

# Check if the shutter is open
is_open = shutter_controller.is_shutter_open()

# Check if the shutter is closed
is_closed = shutter_controller.is_shutter_closed()

# Disconnect from the shutter controller
shutter_controller.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace "COM1" with the appropriate serial port or connection method for your SC10 Shutter Controller.
