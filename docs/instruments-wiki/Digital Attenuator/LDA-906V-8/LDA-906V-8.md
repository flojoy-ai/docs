title: LDA-906V-8
description: The LDA906V-8 Digital Attenuator is a highly accurate, bidirectional, 8-channel step attenuator. It provides calibrated attenuation from 200 to 6000 MHz with an amazing step size of 0.1 dB and typical accuracy <0.25 dB over 90 dB of control range. This Digital Attenuator is an easily portable USB powered device and is sized to fit into a single rack unit for ATE applications. It can be used with WiMAX, 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, DVB and microwave radio fading simulators as well as in engineering and production test labs.

## Connect to the LDA-906V-8 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Qcodes Community" label="Qcodes Community">

Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a LDA-906V-8 Digital Attenuator:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.vaunix.LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-906V-8 Digital Attenuator
attenuator = LDA('attenuator', serial_number=906, channel_names={1: 'ch1', 2: 'ch2', 3: 'ch3', 4: 'ch4', 5: 'ch5', 6: 'ch6', 7: 'ch7', 8: 'ch8'})
station.add_component(attenuator)

# Print the instrument information
print(attenuator.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation of channel 1 to 10 dB
attenuator.ch1.attenuation(10)

# Get the attenuation of channel 1
print(attenuator.ch1.attenuation())

# Close the connection to the instrument
attenuator.close()
```

Note: Make sure you have the necessary DLL files (`VNX_atten64.dll` or `VNX_atten.dll`) in the correct directory and update the `dll_path` in the script if necessary.
