The DS345 Function Generator is a full-featured 30 MHz synthesized function generator that uses an innovative Direct Digital Synthesis (DDS) architecture. It generates many standard waveforms with excellent frequency resolution (1 µHz), and has versatile modulation capabilities including AM, FM, Burst, PM and frequency sweeps. It also generates arbitrary waveforms with a fast 40 Msample/s update rate.

## Connect to the DS345 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Instrumentkit

To connect to a DS345 Function Generator using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik
import instrumentkit.devices.srs as srs

# Connect to the DS345 Function Generator
srs345 = srs.SRS345.open_gpib('/dev/ttyUSB0', 1)

# Set the frequency to 1 MHz
srs345.frequency = 1 * ik.units.MHz

# Get the offset voltage
offset_voltage = srs345.offset

# Set the output function to triangle
srs345.function = srs345.Function.triangle
```

This script imports the necessary modules from Instrumentkit and specifically imports the `SRS345` class from the `instrumentkit.devices.srs` module. It then connects to the DS345 Function Generator using the `open_gpib` method, specifying the appropriate device address.

Once connected, you can interact with the function generator by setting and getting various properties. In the example script, it sets the frequency to 1 MHz using the `frequency` property, gets the offset voltage using the `offset` property, and sets the output function to triangle using the `function` property.

Note that the script assumes you have Instrumentkit and its dependencies installed.
