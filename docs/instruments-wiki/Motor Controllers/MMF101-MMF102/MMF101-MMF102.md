description: These Two-Position, High-Speed Flip Mounts flip lenses, filters, and other optical components into and out of a free-space beam. As shown by the image below, up to two optic mounts can be attached to the same flipper unit, allowing the user to alternate between optics. The flip action can be controlled in four ways-> by the button on the top of the unit, via the included remote handset, via the external SMA connectors, or via a PC running the included software (see the Motion Control Software, Kinesis Tutorials, and APT Tutorials tabs for more information). The flipper position rotates 90° clockwise or counterclockwise when it is toggled and may be toggled either by an absolute signal level (i.e., low and high control voltages correspond to specific flipper positions) or by an edge (i.e., a change in the control voltage level causes the flipper to rotate). The unit has magnetic limit switches at both positions to identify which position the flipper is in.

## Connect to the MMF101-MMF102 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="QCodes Community" label="QCodes Community">

To connect to a Thorlabs MFF101 or MFF102 mirror flipper using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Thorlabs import Thorlabs_APT
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Thorlabs.MFF10x import Thorlabs_MFF10x

# Create a Thorlabs APT server
apt = Thorlabs_APT()

# Connect to the mirror flipper
mff = Thorlabs_MFF10x('mff', device_id=1, apt=apt)

# Create a station and add the mirror flipper
station = Station()
station.add_component(mff)

# Connect to the mirror flipper
mff.connect()

# Now you can use the mirror flipper
print(mff.position())

# Disconnect from the mirror flipper
mff.disconnect()
```

This script creates a Thorlabs APT server and connects to the mirror flipper using the `Thorlabs_MFF10x` instrument driver. It then adds the mirror flipper to a station and connects to it. Finally, it retrieves the current position of the mirror flipper and disconnects from it.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `qcodes` and the Thorlabs APT software.
