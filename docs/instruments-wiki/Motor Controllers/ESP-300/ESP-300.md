sidebar_label: ESP 300
description: This is a Newport ESP300 1 Axis Motion Controller, Model number ESP300-1NN111. It has a 150 Watt power supply and the driver module is rated at 3 amps. This is Newport's most universal motion controller, as it will drive most of Newports actuators and motorized stages. If your Newport stage is an ESP model, this controller will recognize it on power up, and allow you to drive it right away- basically a plug-and-play operation! This unit has been tested and is working correctly.

## Connect to the ESP 300 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="PyMeasure" label="PyMeasure">


```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.newport import ESP300

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB0::1::INSTR")

# Connect to the ESP 300 controller
controller = ESP300(adapter)

# Enable motion for all axes
controller.enable()

# Move the X axis to a specific position
controller.x.position = 10

# Move the Y axis to a specific position
controller.y.position = 20

# Move the Phi axis to a specific position
controller.phi.position = 30

# Wait for all axes to stop moving
controller.x.wait_for_stop()
controller.y.wait_for_stop()
controller.phi.wait_for_stop()

# Disable motion for all axes
controller.disable()

# Close the connection to the controller
controller.shutdown()
```

This script connects to the ESP 300 controller using a VISA adapter, enables motion for all axes, moves each axis to a specific position, waits for all axes to stop moving, disables motion for all axes, and finally closes the connection to the controller.

Note: Make sure to replace `"GPIB0::1::INSTR"` with the appropriate address of your ESP 300 controller.
