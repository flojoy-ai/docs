## Connect to the KIM001 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="InstrumentKit" label="InstrumentKit">

To connect to a KIM001 Positional Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Define the connection parameters
port = "/dev/ttyUSB0"
baudrate = 115200

# Connect to the KIM001 controller
controller = ik.thorlabs.APTPiezoInertiaActuator.open_serial(port, baud=baudrate)

# Get the first channel of the controller
channel = controller.channel[0]

# Enable the channel
channel.enabled_single = True

# Move the channel to a specific position
channel.move_abs(1000)
```

This code connects to the KIM001 controller using the `open_serial` method from the `APTPiezoInertiaActuator` class. It then gets the first channel of the controller and enables it using the `enabled_single` property. Finally, it moves the channel to a specific position using the `move_abs` method.
