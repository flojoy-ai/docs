## Connect to the Keysight B2200A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)

<TabItem value="QCodes" label="QCodes">

To connect to a Keysight B2200A Switch using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.visa import VisaInstrument
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.KeysightB2200 import KeysightB2200

# Create an instance of the KeysightB2200 instrument
switch = KeysightB2200('switch', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
switch.connect_message()

# Perform operations on the switch
switch.connect(1, 2)  # Connect input channel 1 to output channel 2
switch.disconnect(1, 2)  # Disconnect input channel 1 from output channel 2

# Close the connection to the instrument
switch.close()
```

This script creates an instance of the `KeysightB2200` instrument, specifying the instrument name and address. Then, it connects to the instrument using the `connect_message()` method. After that, you can perform operations on the switch, such as connecting and disconnecting input/output pairs using the `connect()` and `disconnect()` methods. Finally, the connection to the instrument is closed using the `close()` method.

Note: Make sure to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual address of your Keysight B2200A Switch.
