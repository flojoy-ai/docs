title: Connecting to LDA-608V-4 by Vaunix in Python
sidebar_label: LDA-608V-4
description: The LDA-608V-4 Digital Attenuator is a highly accurate, bidirectional, 50 Ohm step attenuator with 4 independently controlled attenuator paths. The LDA-608V-4 provides calibrated attenuation from 200 to 8000 MHz with an amazing step size of 0.1 dB and typical accuracy <0.25 dB over 60 dB of control range. The attenuators are easily programmable for fixed attenuation, swept attenuation ramps and fading profiles directly from the included Graphical User Interface (GUI). Alternatively, for users wishing to develop their own interface, Vaunix supplies LabVIEW drivers, Windows API DLL files, Linux drivers, Python examples and much more.

## Connect to the LDA-608V-4 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="QCodes Community" label="QCodes Community">

Here is a Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a LDA-608V-4 Digital Attenuator:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instrument
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-608V-4 Digital Attenuator
attenuator = LDA('attenuator', serial_number=12345678)

# Add the attenuator to the station
station.add_component(attenuator)

# Print the IDN of the attenuator
print(attenuator.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
attenuator.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the attenuator
attenuator.close()
```

Note: Replace `serial_number=12345678` with the actual serial number of your LDA-608V-4 Digital Attenuator.
