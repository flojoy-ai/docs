## Connect to the Keysight N5230C in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Qcodes" label="Qcodes">

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_N5230C import Keysight_N5230C

# Create an instance of the Keysight_N5230C instrument
n5230c = Keysight_N5230C('n5230c', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
n5230c.connect()

# Perform operations with the instrument

# Disconnect from the instrument
n5230c.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your N5230C Network Analyzer.
