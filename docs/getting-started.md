# Flojoy

Flojoy is an open-source desktop app for visual Python scripting. 

Using a simple drag-drop interface, pre-written Python scripts are wired together as nodes in a flow chart. These flow charts can be built up into powerful Python apps for **ETL, DAQ, AI, and simulation**. Advanced Python practioners can add their own custom Python scripts as nodes in the flow chart, which can be published and reused by other Flojoy users.

Free & AGPL licensed.

## Comparable products and projects

- [Ryven - Flow-based visual scripting for Python](https://ryven.org/) - Heroic open-source effort by a single grad student
- [Datablocks](https://datablocks.pro/) - Similar idea to Flojoy, but code blocks are JavaScript instead of Python
- [Apache Airflow Graph View](https://airflow.apache.org/docs/apache-airflow/stable/ui.html#graph-view). Famous project with some nice DAG visualizers, but requires coding and significant learning investment. Flojoy aspires to enable non-coders with similar Python-based ETL capabilities, within minutes of first using the app.
