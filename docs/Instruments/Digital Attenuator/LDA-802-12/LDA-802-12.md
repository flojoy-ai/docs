The LDA-802-12 Digital Attenuator is a rack mounted 12-channel high dynamic range, bidirectional, 50 Ohm step attenuator. The LDA-802-12 provides 120 dB of attenuation control range from 200 to 8000 MHz with a step size of 0.1 dB. The attenuators are easily programmable for fixed attenuation, swept attenuation ramps and fading profiles directly from the included Graphical User Interface (GUI). Alternatively, for users wishing to develop their own interface, Vaunix supplies LabVIEW drivers, Windows API DLL files, Linux drivers, Python examples and much more.

## Connect to the LDA-802-12 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes Community

To connect to a LDA-802-12 using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-802-12
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=80212)

# Add the LDA to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
lda.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA
lda.close()
```

This script creates a `Station` object to hold the instruments. It then creates an instance of the `LDA` driver, specifying the serial number of the LDA-802-12. The LDA is added to the station using the `add_component` method. The IDN of the LDA is printed using the `get_idn` method. The attenuation is set to 10 dB using the `attenuation` parameter. Finally, the connection to the LDA is closed using the `close` method.
