## Instrument Card

<div className="flex">

<div>

The LDA-802-8 Digital Attenuator is an 8-channel high dynamic range, bidirectional, 50 Ohm step attenuator. The LDA-802-8 provides 120 dB of attenuation control range from 200 to 8000 MHz with a step size of 0.1 dB. The attenuators are easily programmable for fixed attenuation, swept attenuation ramps and fading profiles directly from the included Graphical User Interface(GUI). Alternatively, for users wishing to develop their own interface, Vaunix supplies LabVIEW drivers, Windows API DLL files, Linux drivers, Python examples and much more.

## Connect to the LDA-802-8 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Qcodes Community" label="Qcodes Community">

To connect to a LDA-802-8 Digital Attenuator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station, initialise_or_create_database_at
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.vaunix.LDA import LDA

# Create a Qcodes station
station = Station()

# Initialize or create a Qcodes database
initialise_or_create_database_at('C:/path/to/database')

# Connect to the LDA-802-8 Digital Attenuator
attenuator = LDA('attenuator', serial_number=8028)

# Add the attenuator to the station
station.add_component(attenuator)

# Print the IDN of the attenuator
print(attenuator.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
attenuator.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the attenuator
attenuator.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'C:/path/to/database'` with the actual path where you want to create or access the Qcodes database.
