The LDA906V-8 Digital Attenuator is a highly accurate, bidirectional, 8-channel step attenuator. It provides calibrated attenuation from 200 to 6000 MHz with an amazing step size of 0.1 dB and typical accuracy <0.25 dB over 90 dB of control range. This Digital Attenuator is an easily portable USB powered device and is sized to fit into a single rack unit for ATE applications. It can be used with WiMAX, 3G, 4G, 5G, LTE, DVB and microwave radio fading simulators as well as in engineering and production test labs.

## Connect to the LDA-906V-8 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes Community

To connect to a LDA-906V-8 using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-906V-8
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=906, dll_path='path/to/dll')

# Add the LDA to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB on channel 1
lda.ch1.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA
lda.close()
```

Make sure to replace `'path/to/dll'` with the actual path to the DLL files for the LDA-906V-8.
