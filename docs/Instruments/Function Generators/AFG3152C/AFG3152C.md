Users can choose from 12 different standard waveforms. Arbitrary waveforms can be generated up to 128 K in length at high sampling rates. On pulse waveforms, leading and trailing edge time can be set independently. External signals can be connected and added to the output signal. Dual-channel models can generate two identical or completely different signals. All instruments feature a highly stable time base with only ±1 ppm drift per year.

## Connect to the AFG3152C in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Pymeasure


```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import AFG3152C

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")

# Connect to the AFG3152C Function Generator
afg = AFG3152C(adapter)

# Reset the AFG3152C to default settings
afg.reset()

# Set the shape of Channel 1 to sinusoidal
afg.ch1.shape = "sinusoidal"

# Set the unit of Channel 1 to VPP
afg.ch1.unit = "VPP"

# Set the amplitude of Channel 1 to 1 VPP
afg.ch1.amp_vpp = 1

# Set the frequency of Channel 1 to 1 KHz
afg.ch1.frequency = 1e3

# Enable the output of Channel 1
afg.ch1.enable()
```

This script uses the `VISAAdapter` from Pymeasure to establish a connection to the AFG3152C Function Generator using the GPIB interface. It then creates an instance of the `AFG3152C` instrument and sets the desired properties of Channel 1, such as the shape, unit, amplitude, and frequency. Finally, it enables the output of Channel 1.

Note: Make sure to replace `"GPIB::1"` with the appropriate address of your AFG3152C Function Generator.
