# SIM 928

<div>

The SIM928 Isolated Voltage Source is ideal for applications where ultra-clean DC voltage is required. Voltage can be set between ±20 VDC with millivolt resolution, and the source can drive up to ±10 mA. The output circuit is optically isolated from all earth-referenced charging circuitry, providing maximum flexibility and noise immunity. The system can float to ±40 V, and the output is short-circuit protected.

## Connect to the SIM 928 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)

<TabItem value="Qcodes Community" label="Qcodes Community">

To connect to a SIM 928 Power Supply using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.visa import VisaInstrument

class SIM928(VisaInstrument):
    def __init__(self, name, address, **kw):
        super().__init__(name, address=address, terminator='\n', **kw)
        self.add_parameter('voltage', unit='V', get_cmd='VOLT?', set_cmd='VOLT {:.3f}')
        self.add_parameter('current', unit='A', get_cmd='CURR?', set_cmd='CURR {:.3f}')
        self.add_parameter('output', get_cmd='OUTP?', set_cmd='OUTP {}', val_mapping={True: 'ON', False: 'OFF'})
        self.connect_message()

sim = SIM928('sim', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')
```

This script defines a `SIM928` class that inherits from `VisaInstrument` and adds three parameters: `voltage`, `current`, and `output`. The `voltage` parameter represents the output voltage of the power supply, the `current` parameter represents the output current, and the `output` parameter controls the output state (ON/OFF).

To connect to the SIM 928 Power Supply, create an instance of the `SIM928` class and provide the appropriate address (e.g., `TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR`).
