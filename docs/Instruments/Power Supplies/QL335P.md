## Connect to the QL335P in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes

To connect to a QL335P Power Supply using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument.visa import VisaInstrument

class QL335P(VisaInstrument):
    """
    This is the QCoDeS driver for the QL335P power supply.
    """

    def __init__(self, name: str, address: str, **kwargs: Any) -> None:
        """
        Args:
            name: Name to use internally in QCoDeS.
            address: VISA resource address
        """
        super().__init__(name, address, terminator="\n", **kwargs)

        channels = ChannelList(self, "Channels", AimTTiChannel, snapshotable=False)

        _model = self.get_idn()["model"]

        if (_model not in self._numOutputChannels.keys()) or (_model is None):
            raise NotKnownModel("Unknown model, connection cannot be " "established.")

        self.numOfChannels = self._numOutputChannels[_model]
        for i in range(1, self.numOfChannels + 1):
            channel = AimTTiChannel(self, f"ch{i}", i)
            channels.append(channel)
            self.add_submodule(f"ch{i}", channel)

        self.add_submodule("channels", channels.to_channel_tuple())
        self.connect_message()
```

This script defines a `QL335P` class that inherits from `VisaInstrument` provided by Qcodes. It overrides the `__init__` method to initialize the instrument and create the necessary channels.

To use this script, you need to have Qcodes installed and import the necessary modules. Then, you can create an instance of the `QL335P` class by providing the name and address of the power supply:

```python
power_supply = QL335P(name='power_supply', address='YOUR_ADDRESS')
```

Replace `'YOUR_ADDRESS'` with the actual VISA resource address of your QL335P Power Supply.
