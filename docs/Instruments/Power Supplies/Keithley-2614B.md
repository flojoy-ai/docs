<div>

The 2614B SourceMeter SMU Instrument is a new dual-channel SMU instrument with best-in-class value and performance. Its tightly integrated, four-quadrant design allows it to simultaneously source and measure both voltage and current to boost productivity in R&D and bench-top applications. The Model 2614B is equipped with Keithley's high speed TSP technology, which is over 190% faster than traditional PC-to-instrument communication techniques. The Model 2614B is designed for bench-top applications and, therefore, does not have the high-end, system-level automation features of the Model 2612B SourceMeter SMU Instrument, which includes digital I/O, TSP-Link technology, and contact check function.
