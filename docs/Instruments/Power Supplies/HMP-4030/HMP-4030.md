## Connect to the HMP 4030 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)

<TabItem value="Qcodes Community" label="Qcodes Community">

To connect to a Rohde & Schwarz HMP4030 Power Supply using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP4030 import RohdeSchwarzHMP4030

# Create an instance of the HMP4030 driver
hmp = RohdeSchwarzHMP4030('hmp', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
hmp.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument for various operations
# For example, you can set the output voltage
hmp.voltage(5)  # Set the output voltage to 5V

# You can also read the current output voltage
voltage = hmp.voltage()  # Read the output voltage

# Disconnect from the instrument
hmp.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your HMP4030 Power Supply.
