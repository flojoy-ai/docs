# GS200

## Instrument Card

The GS200 is a low voltage/current DC source with high accuracy, high stability, and high resolution. With its excellent traceability, stability, and 5 1/2-digit resolution, the GS200 generates extremely low-noise DC voltage and current signals that are required for many applications. Additionally, the optional monitoring feature turns the GS200 into a voltage and current measuring instrument.

## Connect to the GS200 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Pymeasure


```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.yokogawa import YokogawaGS200

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB0::1::INSTR")

# Connect to the Yokogawa GS200 Power Supply
power_supply = YokogawaGS200(adapter)

# Enable the power supply
power_supply.source_enabled = True

# Set the source mode to voltage
power_supply.source_mode = 'voltage'

# Set the source range to 10V
power_supply.source_range = 10

# Set the voltage limit to 5V
power_supply.voltage_limit = 5

# Set the current limit to 100mA
power_supply.current_limit = 0.1

# Set the source level to 3V
power_supply.source_level = 3

# Ramp the output level to 5V in 1 second
power_supply.trigger_ramp_to_level(5, 1)

# Disable the power supply
power_supply.source_enabled = False

# Disconnect from the power supply
power_supply.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the Yokogawa GS200 Power Supply using a VISA adapter and sets various properties such as enabling the power supply, setting the source mode to voltage, setting the source range, voltage limit, and current limit, and setting the source level. It also demonstrates how to ramp the output level from its current value to a specified level in a specified ramp time. Finally, it disables the power supply and disconnects from it.
