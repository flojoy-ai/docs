## Connect to the HMP 4040 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)

<TabItem value="Qcodes Community" label="Qcodes Community">

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP4040 import RohdeSchwarzHMP4040

# Create an instance of the HMP4040 power supply
hmp = RohdeSchwarzHMP4040('hmp', 'TCPIP0::192.168.0.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the power supply
hmp.connect()

# Perform operations with the power supply
# ...

# Disconnect from the power supply
hmp.disconnect()
```

This code imports the `RohdeSchwarzHMP4040` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.rohde_schwarz.HMP4040` module. It then creates an instance of the power supply by passing the name and address as arguments to the constructor. The address should be the IP address or VISA resource string of the power supply.

The `connect()` method is called to establish a connection to the power supply. You can then perform operations with the power supply using the methods provided by the `RohdeSchwarzHMP4040` class. Finally, the `disconnect()` method is called to close the connection to the power supply.

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import HMP4040

# Create a VISA adapter for communication
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the HMP4040 Power Supply
power_supply = HMP4040(adapter)

# Perform operations on the power supply
power_supply.beep()  # Emit a single beep from the instrument

power_supply.control_method = "REM"  # Set the control method to remote

voltage = power_supply.voltage  # Get the output voltage
print("Output Voltage:", voltage)

current = power_supply.current  # Get the output current
print("Output Current:", current)

power_supply.voltage = 5.0  # Set the output voltage to 5.0 V
power_supply.current = 1.0  # Set the output current to 1.0 A

power_supply.output_enabled = True  # Enable the output

# Disconnect from the power supply
power_supply.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the HMP4040 Power Supply using a VISA adapter and performs various operations such as emitting a beep, setting the control method to remote, getting and setting the output voltage and current, enabling the output, and finally disconnecting from the power supply.
