The 2602B from Keithley is a 2600B series dual channel system SourceMeter® (SMU) instrument (3A DC, 10A pulse). It is an industry’s leading current/voltage source and measure solutions. This dual channel model combines the capabilities of a precision power supply, true current source, 6 1/2 digit DMM, arbitrary waveform generator, pulse generator and electronic load all into one tightly integrated instrument. The result is a powerful solution that significantly boosts productivity in applications ranging from bench-top I-V characterization through highly automated production test. It has 100mV to 40V voltage, 100nA to 10A current measurement range (source). This is tightly integrated, 4-quadrant voltage/current source and measure instrument which offers best in class performance with 6 1/2digit resolution. Built-in web browser based software enables remote control through any browser, on any computer, from anywhere in the world.
