<div>

The 2604B SourceMeter SMU instrument is a new dual channel SMU instrument with best-in-class value and performance. Its tightly integrated four-quadrant design allows it to simultaneously source and measure both voltage and current to boost productivity in R&D and bench-top applications. The Model 2604B is equipped with our high speed TSP technology, which is over 190% faster than traditional PC-to-instrument communication techniques. The Model 2604B is designed for bench-top applications and, therefore, does not have the high-end, system-level automation features of the Model 2602B SourceMeter SMU Instrument that includes digital I/O, TSP-Link technology, and contact check function. The wide range of 3A DC, 10A pulse, 40V output makes the Model 2604B suitable for testing a wide range of higher current devices, materials, components, and sub-assemblies.
