## Connect to the ANC300 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes Community

To connect to an ANC300 Positional Controller using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Attocube.ANC300 import ANC300

# Create an instance of the ANC300 driver
controller = ANC300('controller', 'USB0::0xAAAA::0xBBBB::XXXXXXXX::INSTR')

# Connect to the controller
controller.connect()

# Perform operations on the controller
# For example, get the version information
version_info = controller.version()
print(version_info)

# Close the connection to the controller
controller.close()
```

In the script above, replace `'USB0::0xAAAA::0xBBBB::XXXXXXXX::INSTR'` with the actual VISA address of your ANC300 controller. This address can be obtained from the instrument manager or by using a VISA address finder tool.

The script creates an instance of the `ANC300` driver and connects to the controller using the `connect()` method. It then performs operations on the controller, such as getting the version information. Finally, it closes the connection using the `close()` method.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `qcodes` and `pyvisa`.
