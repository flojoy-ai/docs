This four-channel controller features four SMC outputs to drive piezo inertia devices. The channels can be controlled independently or simultaneously in pairs using the dual-axis joystick on the controller's top panel. The controller can be configured to operate up to four PD series piezo inertia stages, up to four PIA series piezo inertia actuators, or up to two PIM series piezo inertia optic mounts; one KIM101 can only concurrently drive devices that use the same "Select Stage" configuration in the controller's menu options

## Connect to the KIM101 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Instrumentkit" label="Instrumentkit">

Here is an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a KIM101 Positional Controller:

```python
from instrumentkit import KIM101

# Connect to the KIM101 Positional Controller
controller = KIM101()

# Set the position to 0
controller.position = 0

# Move the position to 10
controller.move_to(10)

# Get the current position
position = controller.position
print(f"Current position: {position}")
```

Explanation of the code:
1. Import the `KIM101` class from the `instrumentkit` module.
2. Create an instance of the `KIM101` class, which represents the KIM101 Positional Controller.
3. Set the position of the controller to 0 using the `position` property.
4. Move the position to 10 using the `move_to()` method.
5. Get the current position using the `position` property and print it.
