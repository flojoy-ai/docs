This four-channel controller features four SMC outputs to drive piezo inertia devices. The channels can be controlled independently or simultaneously in pairs using the dual-axis joystick on the controller's top panel. The controller can be configured to operate up to four PD series piezo inertia stages, up to four PIA series piezo inertia actuators, or up to two PIM series piezo inertia optic mounts; one KIM101 can only concurrently drive devices that use the same "Select Stage" configuration in the controller's menu options

## Connect to the KIM101 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Instrumentkit

To connect to a KIM101 Positional Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the KIM101 controller
controller = ik.thorlabs.APTPiezoInertiaActuator.open_serial("/dev/ttyUSB0", baud=115200)

# Get the first channel of the controller
channel = controller.channel[0]

# Enable the channel
channel.enabled_single = True

# Set the drive parameters for the channel
max_volts = ik.units.Quantity(110, ik.units.V)
step_rate = ik.units.Quantity(1000, 1/ik.units.s)
acceleration = ik.units.Quantity(10000, 1/ik.units.s**2)
channel.drive_op_parameters = [max_volts, step_rate, acceleration]

# Move the channel to a specific position
channel.move_abs(1000)
```

This code connects to the KIM101 controller, enables the first channel, sets the drive parameters, and moves the channel to a specific position.
