## Connect to the KIM001 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Instrumentkit" label="Instrumentkit">

Here is an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a KIM001 Positional Controller:

```python
from instrumentkit import Instrument, ConnectionType

# Define the connection parameters
connection_type = ConnectionType.SERIAL
port = "/dev/ttyUSB0"
baudrate = 9600

# Create an Instrument object for the KIM001 Positional Controller
controller = Instrument("KIM001", connection_type, port, baudrate)

# Connect to the controller
controller.connect()

# Send commands to the controller
controller.send_command("MOVE 100")  # Move the controller to position 100

# Disconnect from the controller
controller.disconnect()
```

Note: This code assumes that you have already installed the `instrumentkit` package.
