The ESP301-3N 3 Axis Motion Controller and Driver is the successor of the popular ESP300 motion controller. The ESP301 provides the same functionality as the ESP300 with a standard USB interface and extended front panel functions. For maximum backward compatibility, the ESP301 features the same motion commands and control algorithms and the same casing as the ESP300. The ESP301-3N drives and controls up to three axes of motion using any combination of DC or 2-phase stepper motors up to 3A per axis. This capability enables driving a large selection of Newport stages and actuators. Featuring an integrated manual front panel interface and Newport's unique ESP stage auto-detection and auto-configuration, the ESP301 provides most easy operation and excellent functionality at an affordable price.
