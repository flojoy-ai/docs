The LPS710E(/M) Amplified Piezo Stage provides long range, fine focus Z-axis travel for a microscope slide while maintaining a compact, low-profile footprint. It features submicron repeatability, nanometer positioning resolution, low angular error, and fast millisecond response and settling times. When used with the LPSA1(/M) microscope slide holder, the stage is ideal for imaging modalities requiring sensitive sample positioning and sectioning, such as confocal laser scanning microscopy. This stage is not compatible with trans-illumination.
