This is a Newport ESP300 1 Axis Motion Controller, Model number ESP300-1NN111. It has a 150 Watt power supply and the driver module is rated at 3 amps. This is Newport's most universal motion controller, as it will drive most of Newports actuators and motorized stages. If your Newport stage is an ESP model, this controller will recognize it on power up, and allow you to drive it right away- basically a plug-and-play operation! This unit has been tested and is working correctly.

## Connect to the ESP 300 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Pymeasure" label="Pymeasure">


```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.newport import ESP300

# Connect to the ESP 300 controller
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")
controller = ESP300(adapter)

# Enable the axes
controller.enable()

# Move the x-axis to a specific position
controller.x.position = 10

# Move the y-axis to a specific position
controller.y.position = 20

# Move the phi-axis to a specific position
controller.phi.position = 30

# Wait for the motion to complete
controller.x.wait_for_stop()
controller.y.wait_for_stop()
controller.phi.wait_for_stop()

# Disable the axes
controller.disable()

# Close the connection to the controller
controller.shutdown()
```

This script connects to the ESP 300 controller using a VISA adapter and creates an instance of the `ESP300` class. It then enables the axes, sets the positions of the x, y, and phi axes, waits for the motion to complete, disables the axes, and finally shuts down the controller.

Note: You will need to install the `pymeasure` package and have the appropriate VISA drivers installed to run this script.
