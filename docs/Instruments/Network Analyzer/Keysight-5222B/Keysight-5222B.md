## Connect to the Keysight 5222B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Qcodes" label="Qcodes">

To connect to a Keysight 5222B Network Analyzer using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_5222B import Keysight_5222B

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the Keysight 5222B Network Analyzer
na = Keysight_5222B('na', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')
station.add_component(na)

# Print the available options on the Network Analyzer
print(na.get_options())

# Set the frequency range
na.start(1e6)
na.stop(1e9)

# Set the power range
na._set_power_limits(-30, 10)

# Enable trace averaging
na.averages_on()

# Perform a sweep and get the magnitude data
magnitude_data = na.traces[0].magnitude()

# Print the magnitude data
print(magnitude_data)

# Disconnect from the Network Analyzer
na.close()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your Keysight 5222B Network Analyzer.
