## Connect to the Keysight 34934A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Qcodes" label="Qcodes">

To connect to a Keysight 34934A DAQ board using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import VisaInstrument

# Connect to the DAQ board
daq = VisaInstrument('DAQ', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Create an instance of the Keysight34934A module
module = Keysight34934A(daq, 'module1', 1)

# Set the relay protection mode to 'AUTO100'
module.protection_mode('AUTO100')

# Get the relay protection mode
mode = module.protection_mode()

# Print the relay protection mode
print(f"Relay protection mode: {mode}")

# Disconnect from the DAQ board
daq.close()
```

Note: Make sure to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA address of your DAQ board.
