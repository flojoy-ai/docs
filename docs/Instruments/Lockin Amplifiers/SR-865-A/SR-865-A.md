## Connect to the SR 865 A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)

<TabItem value="Qcodes" label="Qcodes">

To connect to a SR 865 A Lockin Amplifier using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.stanford_research.SR865 import SR865

# Create an instance of the SR865 instrument
lockin = SR865("lockin", "TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Connect to the instrument
lockin.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform various operations
# For example, you can get the X and Y values
x = lockin.X()
y = lockin.Y()

# You can also set the frequency and amplitude
lockin.frequency(1000)  # Set the frequency to 1000 Hz
lockin.amplitude(0.1)   # Set the amplitude to 0.1 V

# Disconnect from the instrument
lockin.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual address of your lock-in amplifier.
