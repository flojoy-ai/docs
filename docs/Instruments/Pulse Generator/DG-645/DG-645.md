<div>

The DG645 is a versatile digital delay/pulse generator that provides precisely defined pulses at repetition rates up to 10 MHz. The instrument offers several improvements over older designs—lower jitter, higher accuracy, faster trigger rates, and more outputs. The DG645 also has Ethernet, GPIB and RS-232 interfaces for computer or network control of the instrument.

## Connect to the DG 645 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Qcodes Community" label="Qcodes Community">

To connect to a DG645 Pulse Generator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import create_instrument

# Connect to the DG645 Pulse Generator
dg645 = create_instrument('DG645', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Now you can use the instrument object 'dg645' to control the pulse generator
# For example, you can set the trigger rate
dg645.trigger_rate(1000)  # Set the trigger rate to 1000 Hz

# You can also read the current trigger source
trigger_source = dg645.trigger_source()
print(f"Current trigger source: {trigger_source}")

# Close the connection to the instrument
dg645.close()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual VISA address of your DG645 Pulse Generator.
