## Connect to the Keysight 34410A Submodules in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Qcodes" label="Qcodes">

To connect to a Keysight 34410A Multimeter using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_344xxA import Keysight34410A

# Create an instance of the Keysight34410A driver
multimeter = Keysight34410A('multimeter', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the multimeter
multimeter.connect()

# Perform measurements or other operations with the multimeter

# Disconnect from the multimeter
multimeter.disconnect()
```

This script imports the `Keysight34410A` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_344xxA` module. It then creates an instance of the `Keysight34410A` driver, passing the name and address of the multimeter as arguments to the constructor.

The `connect()` method is called to establish a connection to the multimeter. You can then perform measurements or other operations using the methods provided by the driver.

Finally, the `disconnect()` method is called to close the connection to the multimeter.
