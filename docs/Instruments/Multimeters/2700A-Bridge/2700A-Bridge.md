<div className="flex">

<div>

The Andeen-Hagerling AH 2700A offers unparalleled stability, resolution, linearity and accuracy in a multi-frequency capacitance/loss bridge. Its numerous state-of-the-art features make it an exceptionally user-friendly instrument, measuring capacitance and loss in medium and high impedance ranges, and thus allows using three-terminal rather than five-terminal connections to the DUT (Device Under Test).

The new AH 2700A-E offers substantially improved resolution over the entire operating range, bringing a super-sensitivity that enables it to explore applications in calibration, scientific research, and manufacturing with a new precision.

The AH2700A-E is the pinnacle of decades of Andeen-Hagerling experience in bridge design and manufacture, and is complemented by its sister model, the AH2700A-E-C that offers continuous frequency scanning.
