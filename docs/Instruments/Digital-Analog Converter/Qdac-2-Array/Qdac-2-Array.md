QDAC-II is the next generation of the successful QDAC from QDevil. It has all the outstanding features from its predecessor but is even more versatile and with superior performance. QDAC-II is a high-precision ultra-low-noise computer controlled DAC with 24 voltage generators, operating at a sample rate of 1MS/s – a thousand times faster than its predecessor. It is designed for DC and intermediate-frequency control of quantum devices, including, for example, gate electrodes and flux bias coils in qubits, but is a very versatile instrument that can be used for many other purposes. Each of the 24 channels has five voltage generators working in parallel: One for DC, a sine generator, a triangle generator, a square wave generator, and an arbitrary waveform generator (1 million points/second). Additionally, each channel is equipped with a DC current sensor with a resolution down to a few tens of pA, typically used for gate leakage detection and with sample rates up to 3 kHz.
