The new Keysight N7776C top line tunable laser source is designed to reach best-in-class accuracy in static and swept operation for outstanding test efficiency. Two-way sweeps up to 200 nm/s speed with sub-picometer repeatability and without impacting the specified dynamic accuracy accelerate wavelength-dependent alignment processes and the automated calibration of wavelength-selective devices. Shorter time to testing and faster swept-wavelength tests help reduce test cost per device, improve test margins and lower the cost of ownership.
