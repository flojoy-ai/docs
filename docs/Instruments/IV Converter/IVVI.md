## Instrument Card

An ohmmeter is an electrical instrument that measures electrical resistance (the opposition offered by a circuit or component to the flow of electric current). Multimeters also function as ohmmeters when in resistance-measuring mode. An ohmmeter applies current to the circuit or component whose resistance is to be measured. It then measures the resulting voltage and calculates the resistance using Ohmâ€™s law	https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ohmmeter

## Connect to the IVVI in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes Community


```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.ivvi import IVVI

# Create an instance of the IVVI instrument
ivvi = IVVI('ivvi', 'ASRL1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
ivvi.connect()

# Set the voltage of DAC 1 to 1000 mV
ivvi.dac1(1000)

# Get the voltage of DAC 1
voltage = ivvi.dac1()

# Print the voltage
print(f"Voltage of DAC 1: {voltage} mV")

# Disconnect from the instrument
ivvi.disconnect()
```

In this example, we first import the `IVVI` class from the `qcodes.instrument_drivers.ivvi` module. We then create an instance of the `IVVI` instrument, passing the name of the instrument and the address (ASRL address in this case) as arguments.

Next, we connect to the instrument using the `connect()` method. We can then use the instrument's parameters and functions to interact with the IVVI IV Converter. In this example, we set the voltage of DAC 1 to 1000 mV using the `dac1()` parameter and get the voltage of DAC 1 using the same parameter.

Finally, we disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.

Note: Make sure to replace `'ASRL1::INSTR'` with the actual address of your IVVI IV Converter.
