## Connect to the TC-038D in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Instrumentkit

Here is an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a TC-038D Temperature Controller:

```python
from instrumentkit import hcp

# Connect to the TC-038D Temperature Controller
inst = hcp.TC038D.open_serial('COM10')

# Set the setpoint temperature to 45.3°C
inst.setpoint = 45.3

# Get the current temperature
temperature = inst.temperature

print(temperature)
```

Explanation:
1. The script imports the `hcp` module from `instrumentkit`.
2. It then connects to the TC-038D Temperature Controller using the `open_serial` method, specifying the serial port as the argument.
3. The setpoint temperature is set to 45.3°C by assigning the desired value to the `setpoint` property of the instrument object.
4. The current temperature is obtained by accessing the `temperature` property of the instrument object.
5. Finally, the temperature is printed to the console.
