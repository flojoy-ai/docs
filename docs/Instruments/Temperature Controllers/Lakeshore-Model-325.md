## Instrument Card

<div className="flex">

<div>

The Model 325 dual-channel cryogenic temperature controller is capable of supporting nearly any diode, RTD, or thermocouple temperature sensor. Two independent PID control loops with heater outputs of 25 W and 2 W are configured to drive either a 50 立 or 25 立 load for optimal cryocooler control flexibility. Designed with ease of use, functionality, and value in mind, the Model 325 is ideal for general-purpose laboratory and industrial temperature measurement and control applications.
