## Instrument Card

<div className="flex">

<div>

The TC200 Temperature Controller is a bench top controller intended for use with resistive heating elements
rated up to 18 Watts. This general purpose instrument can drive various types of heaters, including foil and
resistive coil types. It accepts feedback from either positive or negative temperature coefficient thermistors, has
programmable P, I, and D gains, and will display the temperature in 째C, 째F, or K. In addition, it can be
programmed for up to five sequential temperature settings along with associated ramp and hold times for each
level. A user-programmable maximum temperature limit provides protection to the device being heated, and a
user-programmable power limit protects the heating element from being over driven.

## Connect to the TC200 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Instrumentkit" label="Instrumentkit">

Here is an example Python script that uses Instrumentkit to connect to a TC200 Temperature Controller:

```python
from instrumentkit import Instrument, ConnectionType

# Define the TC200 Temperature Controller class
class TC200(Instrument):
    def __init__(self, connection_type, address):
        super().__init__(connection_type, address)

    def get_temperature(self):
        return self.query("READ:TEMP?")

# Create an instance of the TC200 Temperature Controller
tc200 = TC200(ConnectionType.SERIAL, "/dev/ttyUSB0")

# Connect to the TC200 Temperature Controller
tc200.connect()

# Get the temperature from the TC200 Temperature Controller
temperature = tc200.get_temperature()
print(f"Temperature: {temperature}")

# Disconnect from the TC200 Temperature Controller
tc200.disconnect()
```

Note: This code assumes that you have already installed the `instrumentkit` package.
