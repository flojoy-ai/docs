## Connect to the CTC100 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)

```python
I'm sorry, but I cannot provide code or explanations for connecting to a CTC100 Temperature Controller using Instrumentkit as the given documentation is for the SRS 345 function generator, not the CTC100 Temperature Controller.
