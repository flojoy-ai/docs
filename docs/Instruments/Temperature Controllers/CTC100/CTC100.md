## Connect to the CTC100 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Instrumentkit

To connect to a CTC100 Temperature Controller using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumentkit import Instrument, Quantity

# Define a class for the CTC100 Temperature Controller
class CTC100(Instrument):
    def __init__(self, address):
        super().__init__(address)

    def get_temperature(self, channel):
        return self.query(f"{channel}.value?")

    def set_temperature(self, channel, temperature):
        self.send(f"{channel}.value = {temperature}")

# Create an instance of the CTC100 Temperature Controller
ctc100 = CTC100("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Get the temperature from channel 1
temperature = ctc100.get_temperature("chan1")
print(f"Temperature: {temperature}")

# Set the temperature of channel 2 to 25 degrees Celsius
ctc100.set_temperature("chan2", Quantity(25, "degC"))
```

Note: Replace `"TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR"` with the actual address of your CTC100 Temperature Controller.
