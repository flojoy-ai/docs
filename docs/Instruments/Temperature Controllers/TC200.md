## Instrument Card

The TC200 Temperature Controller is a bench top controller intended for use with resistive heating elements
rated up to 18 Watts. This general purpose instrument can drive various types of heaters, including foil and
resistive coil types. It accepts feedback from either positive or negative temperature coefficient thermistors, has
programmable P, I, and D gains, and will display the temperature in °C, °F, or K. In addition, it can be
programmed for up to five sequential temperature settings along with associated ramp and hold times for each
level. A user-programmable maximum temperature limit provides protection to the device being heated, and a
user-programmable power limit protects the heating element from being over driven.

## Connect to the TC200 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Instrumentkit


```python
from instrumentkit import SerialConnection
from instrumentkit import TC200

# Create a serial connection to the TC200 Temperature Controller
connection = SerialConnection(port='/dev/ttyUSB0', baudrate=9600)
tc200 = TC200(connection)

# Get the name and version number of the device
name = tc200.name()
print(f"Device Name: {name}")

# Get the current output mode of the TC200
mode = tc200.mode
print(f"Output Mode: {mode}")

# Set the output mode to 'cycle'
tc200.mode = TC200.Mode.cycle

# Get the current enable status of the heater
enable = tc200.enable
print(f"Heater Enable: {enable}")

# Set the enable status to True (turn on the heater)
tc200.enable = True

# Get the current temperature of the sensor
temperature = tc200.temperature
print(f"Temperature: {temperature}")

# Get the maximum temperature setting
max_temperature = tc200.max_temperature
print(f"Max Temperature: {max_temperature}")

# Set the maximum temperature to 100 degrees Celsius
tc200.max_temperature = 100

# Get the current set temperature
temperature_set = tc200.temperature_set
print(f"Set Temperature: {temperature_set}")

# Set the temperature setpoint to 50 degrees Celsius
tc200.temperature_set = 50

# Get the current P, I, D gains of the PID controller
pid = tc200.pid
print(f"PID Gains: {pid}")

# Set the P, I, D gains of the PID controller to [10, 5, 2]
tc200.pid = [10, 5, 2]

# Get the current temperature units
degrees = tc200.degrees
print(f"Temperature Units: {degrees}")

# Set the temperature units to degrees Fahrenheit
tc200.degrees = u.degF

# Get the current thermistor type
sensor = tc200.sensor
print(f"Thermistor Type: {sensor}")

# Set the thermistor type to 'ptc1000'
tc200.sensor = TC200.Sensor.ptc1000

# Get the current beta value of the thermistor curve
beta = tc200.beta
print(f"Beta Value: {beta}")

# Set the beta value of the thermistor curve to 3000
tc200.beta = 3000

# Get the maximum power setting
max_power = tc200.max_power
print(f"Max Power: {max_power}")

# Set the maximum power to 10 Watts
tc200.max_power = 10

# Close the connection to the TC200 Temperature Controller
tc200.close()
```

Note: Make sure to replace `/dev/ttyUSB0` with the appropriate serial port for your TC200 Temperature Controller.
