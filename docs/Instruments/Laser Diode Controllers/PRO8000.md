The PRO8000 Chassis can accept up to 8 modules and is ideally suited for the needs of large test setups. This made-to-order chassis can be custom configured with up to eight modules that best meet individual experimental needs prior to purchase. The chassis can also be ordered empty, without any pre-installed modules. The empty slots of the PRO8000 can be covered using PRO8000-C front cover plates.

The code provided defines a class `ThorlabsPro8000` that represents the Thorlabs Pro 8000 modular laser driver. It is a subclass of `Instrument` from the `pymeasure.instruments` module.

The class has several attributes and methods that allow control of the laser diode and TEC (Thermoelectric Cooler) functionalities of the Pro 8000.

The class attributes include:
- `SLOTS`: A range of valid slot numbers (1 to 8) for selecting the daughter board.
- `LDC_POLARITIES`: A list of valid laser diode polarities ('AG' and 'CG').
- `STATUS`: A list of valid status values ('ON' and 'OFF').

The class constructor `__init__` initializes the instrument by calling the parent class constructor and sending a command to the instrument.

The class also defines several control properties using the `Instrument.control` decorator. These control properties allow reading and writing of instrument parameters using the specified SCPI commands.

The control properties include:
- `slot`: Control the slot selection.
- `LDCCurrent`: Control the laser current.
- `LDCCurrentLimit`: Set the software current limit.
- `LDCPolarity`: Set the laser diode polarity.
- `LDCStatus`: Set the laser diode status.
- `TEDStatus`: Control the TEC status.
- `TEDSetTemperature`: Control the TEC temperature.

Each control property is associated with a specific SCPI command and has additional information such as a description, validator, and allowed values.

This code provides a convenient way to interact with the Thorlabs Pro 8000 laser driver using the PyMeasure library.
