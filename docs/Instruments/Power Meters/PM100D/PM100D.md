## Connect to the PM100D in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Instrumental

Here is a Python script that uses Instrumental to connect to a PM100D Power Meter:

```python
from instrumental import instrument, list_instruments

# List all available instruments
print(list_instruments())

# Connect to the PM100D Power Meter
pm100d = instrument('Thorlabs PM100D')

# Get the current power reading
power = pm100d.power()
print('Current power:', power)

# Set the input signal wavelength to 1550 nm
pm100d.wavelength = 1550

# Get the input signal wavelength
wavelength = pm100d.wavelength
print('Current wavelength:', wavelength)

# Make a multi-sample power measurement
measurement = pm100d.measure(n_samples=10)
print('Average power:', measurement.nominal_value)
print('Power uncertainty:', measurement.std_dev)

# Close the connection to the Power Meter
pm100d.close()
```

This script first lists all available instruments using the `list_instruments()` function. Then, it connects to the PM100D Power Meter using the `instrument()` function and assigns it to the variable `pm100d`.

The script then demonstrates various operations with the Power Meter. It retrieves the current power reading using the `power()` method and prints it. It sets the input signal wavelength to 1550 nm using the `wavelength` attribute. It retrieves the current wavelength using the `wavelength` attribute and prints it.

Finally, the script makes a multi-sample power measurement using the `measure()` method with 10 samples. It retrieves the average power and power uncertainty from the measurement and prints them.

The script ends by closing the connection to the Power Meter using the `close()` method.
