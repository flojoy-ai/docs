<div>

Quantum Design's DynaCool™ PPMS® performs electrical, thermal and magnetic measurements while controlling the samples temperature and magnetic environment.The system uses a single two-stage pulse tube cooler to cool both the superconducting magnet and provide temperature control below 10K, resulting in a low vibration environment for sample measurements. At low temperatures a small amount of Helium-4 is condensed and used to cool the sample while the magnet is cooled through solid contact to a 4 K plate.
