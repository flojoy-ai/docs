## Connect to the LKS 425 Gaussmeter in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Pytango" label="Pytango">

To connect to a Lake Shore Model 425 Gaussmeter using Pytango, you can use the following code:

```python
import PyTango

# Create a DeviceProxy for the Gaussmeter
gaussmeter_proxy = PyTango.DeviceProxy("device/hostname/instance")

# Call the relevant methods on the Gaussmeter proxy
# For example, to get the serial number:
serial_number = gaussmeter_proxy.read_attribute("SerialNumber").value

# To get the current magnetic field reading:
magnetic_field = gaussmeter_proxy.read_attribute("MagneticField").value

# To set the measurement range:
gaussmeter_proxy.write_attribute("MeasurementRange", 1)

# To start a measurement:
gaussmeter_proxy.command_inout("StartMeasurement")

# To stop a measurement:
gaussmeter_proxy.command_inout("StopMeasurement")
```

Note that you need to replace `"device/hostname/instance"` with the actual Tango device name or alias for your Lake Shore Model 425 Gaussmeter.
