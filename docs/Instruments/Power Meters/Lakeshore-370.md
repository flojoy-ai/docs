<div>

The Model 370 AC resistance bridge is designed for precise, accurate, low noise, low excitation power AC resistance measurements. Its primary application is the measurement of resistive materials in cryogenic environments from 20 mK to 1 K. Fully integrated, the Model 370 includes features to reduce and control noise at every step of the resistance measurement process. A unique, patented, matched impedance current source and active common mode reduction circuitry minimize noise and self-heating errors. With up to 16 channels, IEEE-488 and serial interfaces, and closed loop temperature control, the Model 370 offers seamless integration with existing cryogenic systems and is the most complete package on the market today. Used with Lake Shore calibrated subkelvin resistance temperature sensors, it not only measures and displays, but also controls temperature for dilution refrigerators and other cryogenic systems.
