## Instrument Card

The 33250A 80 MHz Function/Arbitrary Waveform Generator uses direct digital-synthesis techniques to create a stable, accurate output on all waveforms, down to 1 µHz frequency resolution. The benefits are apparent in every signal you produce, from the sine wave frequency accuracy to the fast rise/fall times of square waves, to the ramp linearity.
