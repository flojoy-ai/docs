<div>

The industry-leading AWG70000A Series arbitrary waveform generator (AWG) provides you with unparalleled performance at the cutting edge for sample rate, signal fidelity, and waveform memory. In order to engineer the world's most complex data communications systems, the ability to create ideal, distorted and "real life" signals is essential. The AWG70000A Series of AWGs delivers this, giving you the industry's best signal stimulus solution for ever-increasing measurement challenges. With up to 50 GS/s and 10-bit vertical resolution, it offers easy generation of very complex signals and complete control over signal characteristics.

## Connect to the AWG70002A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes

Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a AWG70002A RF Signal Generator:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.AWG70000A import AWG70000A

# Connect to the AWG70002A RF Signal Generator
awg = AWG70000A('awg', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Print the instrument ID
print(awg.IDN())

# Set the sample rate to 1 GHz
awg.sample_rate(1e9)

# Set the amplitude of channel 1 to 0.5 V
awg.channels.ch1.awg_amplitude(0.5)

# Set the frequency of channel 1 to 1 MHz
awg.channels.ch1.fgen_frequency(1e6)

# Run the AWG
awg.play()

# Stop the AWG
awg.stop()

# Close the connection to the AWG
awg.close()
```

Note: Make sure to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA resource name of your AWG70002A RF Signal Generator.
