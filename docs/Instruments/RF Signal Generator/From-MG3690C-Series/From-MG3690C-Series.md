```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.anritsu import AnritsuMG3692C

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB0::10::INSTR")

# Connect to the Anritsu MG3692C Signal Generator
signal_generator = AnritsuMG3692C(adapter)

# Set the output power to -10 dBm
signal_generator.power = -10

# Set the output frequency to 1 GHz
signal_generator.frequency = 1e9

# Enable the signal output
signal_generator.enable()

# Disable the signal output
signal_generator.disable()

# Shutdown the instrument
signal_generator.shutdown()
```

Explanation of the code:
- First, we import the necessary modules from Pymeasure.
- We create a `VISAAdapter` object, specifying the VISA address of the instrument. In this example, the address is "GPIB0::10::INSTR".
- We create an `AnritsuMG3692C` object, passing the adapter as an argument.
- We can then use the properties and methods of the `AnritsuMG3692C` object to control the signal generator. For example, we set the output power to -10 dBm using the `power` property, and the output frequency to 1 GHz using the `frequency` property.
- We can enable or disable the signal output using the `enable()` and `disable()` methods.
- Finally, we call the `shutdown()` method to put the instrument in a safe state.

Note: Make sure you have the necessary dependencies installed, such as `pymeasure` and the appropriate VISA library for your instrument.
