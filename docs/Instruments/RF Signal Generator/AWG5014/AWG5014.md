## Connect to the AWG5014 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Qcodes" label="Qcodes">

Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a Tektronix AWG5014 RF Signal Generator:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.AWG5014 import TektronixAWG5014

# Connect to the AWG5014
awg = TektronixAWG5014('awg', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Set the waveform for channel 1
awg.ch1_waveform('SINE')

# Set the amplitude for channel 1
awg.ch1_amplitude(0.5)

# Set the frequency for channel 1
awg.ch1_frequency(1e6)

# Run the AWG
awg.run()

# Disconnect from the AWG5014
awg.close()
```

This script imports the necessary modules and creates an instance of the `TektronixAWG5014` class to connect to the AWG5014 RF Signal Generator. It then sets the waveform, amplitude, and frequency for channel 1, and runs the AWG. Finally, it disconnects from the AWG5014.

Note that you will need to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual address of your AWG5014.
