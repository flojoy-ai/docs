## Connect to the Keysight 33521 A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)

Here is a Python script that uses Pymeasure to connect to a Keysight 33521A RF Signal Generator:

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import Agilent33500

# Create a connection to the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB::1")
generator = Agilent33500(adapter)

# Set the output waveform shape to sine
generator.shape = 'SIN'

# Set the frequency to 1 kHz
generator.frequency = 1e3

# Set the amplitude to 1 Vpp
generator.amplitude = 1

# Enable the output
generator.output = True

# Disconnect from the instrument
generator.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the instrument using the VISAAdapter and creates an instance of the Agilent33500 class. It then sets the output waveform shape to sine, frequency to 1 kHz, amplitude to 1 Vpp, and enables the output. Finally, it disconnects from the instrument.
