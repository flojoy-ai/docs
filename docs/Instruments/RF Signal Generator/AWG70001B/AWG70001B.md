The AWG70000B Series Arbitrary Waveform Generator represents the cutting edge in sample rate, signal fidelity and waveform memory, making it ideal for design, testing and operations of complex components, systems and experiments. With up to sample rate of 50 GS/s and 10-bit vertical resolution, it delivers the industry's best signal stimulus solution for easy generation of ideal, distorted and “real-life” signals.

## Connect to the AWG70001B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes

To connect to a AWG70001B RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.AWG70000A import AWG70000A

# Create an instance of the AWG70000A driver
awg = AWG70000A('awg', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
awg.connect()

# Now you can use the AWG70000A methods and parameters to control the instrument
# For example, you can set the amplitude of channel 1 to 0.5 V
awg.ch1.awg_amplitude(0.5)

# You can also play a waveform or sequence
awg.ch1.setWaveform('waveform_name')
awg.play()

# Remember to disconnect from the instrument when you are done
awg.disconnect()
```

Please note that you need to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA resource name or IP address of your AWG70001B RF Signal Generator.
