## Connect to the AWG5208 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.AWG5208 import AWG5208

# Connect to the AWG5208 RF Signal Generator
awg = AWG5208('awg', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Perform operations with the AWG5208
awg.ch1.frequency(1e9)
awg.ch1.amplitude(0.5)
awg.ch1.output('ON')

# Close the connection to the AWG5208
awg.close()
```
