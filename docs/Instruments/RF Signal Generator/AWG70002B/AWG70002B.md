The AWG70000B Series Arbitrary Waveform Generator represents the cutting edge in sample rate, signal fidelity and waveform memory, making it ideal for design, testing and operations of complex components, systems and experiments. With up to sample rate of 50 GS/s and 10-bit vertical resolution, it delivers the industry's best signal stimulus solution for easy generation of ideal, distorted and “real-life” signals.

## Connect to the AWG70002B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes

To connect to a AWG70002B RF Signal Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.AWG70000A import AWG70000A

# Create an instance of the AWG70000A instrument
awg = AWG70000A('awg', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
awg.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform various operations
# For example, you can set the amplitude of channel 1 to 0.5 V
awg.ch1.awg_amplitude(0.5)

# You can also play a waveform on channel 2
awg.ch2.setWaveform('waveform_name')

# Finally, you can disconnect from the instrument
awg.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual VISA resource name of your AWG70002B RF Signal Generator.
