The AWG520's unique design combines a graphical editing display with powerful output capabilities to simplify the creation of arbitrary and complex waveforms and enable easy on-screen waveform editing. With the AWG520's many built-in intuitive and powerful features, you can easily develop and edit custom waveforms. Option 03 adds an independent 10–bit-wide digital data port that can be used in conjunction with marker outputs for data generation up to 14–bits wide at up to 1 GHz (14–bits, AWG520). Direct waveform transfer capability makes the AWG520 the perfect complement to selected Tektronix oscilloscopes.

## Connect to the AWG520 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes Community

To connect to a AWG520 RF Signal Generator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Instrument

class AWG520(Instrument):
    def __init__(self, name, address):
        super().__init__(name, address)

        # Add parameters and functions here

# Create an instance of the AWG520 instrument
awg = AWG520('awg', 'GPIB0::1::INSTR')

# Connect to the AWG520 instrument
awg.connect()

# Perform operations on the AWG520 instrument
# ...

# Disconnect from the AWG520 instrument
awg.disconnect()
```

Note: The code provided is a skeleton for connecting to the AWG520 instrument. You will need to add the necessary parameters and functions based on the documentation provided.
