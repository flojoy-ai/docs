<div>

PXA signal analyzers are ideally suited for high-performance research and development (R&D) applications in aerospace/defense and commercial wireless communications. The PXA analyzes signals over wider bandwidths, reduces measurement uncertainty, and reveals previously hidden signals with noise floor extension (NFE). Unravel complex signals through the PXA’s broad set of measurement applications and demodulation capabilities or add real-time spectrum analysis capabilities with an upgradeable option.
