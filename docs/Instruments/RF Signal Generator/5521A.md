## Connect to the 5521A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes Community

```python
from qcodes import Station, initialise_or_create_database_at
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.signal_core.sc5521a import SC5521A

# Create a QCoDeS station
station = Station()

# Initialise or create a QCoDeS database
initialise_or_create_database_at('path_to_database')

# Create an instance of the SC5521A instrument
signal_generator = SC5521A('signal_generator', dll_path='path_to_dll')

# Add the instrument to the station
station.add_component(signal_generator)

# Connect to the instrument
signal_generator.connect()

# Access and control the instrument parameters
signal_generator.frequency(1e9)
signal_generator.power(-10)
signal_generator.status('on')

# Disconnect from the instrument
signal_generator.disconnect()
```
Note: Replace `'path_to_database'` with the desired path for the QCoDeS database file, and `'path_to_dll'` with the actual path to the SC5521A DLL file.
