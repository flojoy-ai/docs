## Connect to the MSO70000 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Tektronix_DPO7000xx import TektronixDPO7000xx

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = TektronixDPO7000xx("oscilloscope", "TCPIP::1.2.3.4::INSTR")

# Print the available channels
print(oscilloscope.channel)

# Set the time per division
oscilloscope.horizontal.scale(1e-6)

# Set the trigger type and source
oscilloscope.trigger.A.type("edge")
oscilloscope.trigger.A.source("CH1")

# Enable the measurement and set the measurement type
measurement = oscilloscope.measurement.measurement1
measurement.state(1)
measurement.type("amplitude")

# Get the measurement value
value = measurement.get()
print(value)

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```
