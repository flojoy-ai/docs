```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Tektronix_DPO7000xx import TektronixDPO7000xx

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = TektronixDPO7000xx("oscilloscope", "TCPIP::1.2.3.4::INSTR")

# Print the available channels
print(oscilloscope.channel)

# Set the time per division
oscilloscope.horizontal.scale(1e-6)  # 1 microsecond per division

# Set the trigger type and source
oscilloscope.trigger.A.type("edge")
oscilloscope.trigger.A.source("CH1")

# Enable the measurement and set the measurement type
measurement = oscilloscope.measurement.measurement1
measurement.state(1)
measurement.type("amplitude")

# Get the measurement value
amplitude = measurement.get()

# Print the amplitude
print(f"Amplitude: {amplitude} V")

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```
This script connects to a Tektronix MSO70000 Oscilloscope using the QCoDeS driver. It sets the time per division to 1 microsecond, sets the trigger type to "edge" and the trigger source to "CH1". It enables the measurement and sets the measurement type to "amplitude". It then retrieves the amplitude measurement value and prints it. Finally, it disconnects from the oscilloscope.
