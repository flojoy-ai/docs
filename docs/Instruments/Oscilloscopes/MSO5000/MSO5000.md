With the MSO/DPO5000 Mixed Signal Oscilloscope Series, you can analyze up to 20 analog and digital signals with a single instrument to quickly find and diagnose problems in complex designs. Bandwidths up to 2 GHz and sample rates up to 10 GS/s ensure you have the performance you need to see fast-changing signal details. To capture long windows of signal activity while maintaining fine timing resolution, the MSO/DPO5000 Series offers a deep record length of up to 12.5 M points standard on all channels and an optional record length of up to 250 M points on two channels.

## Connect to the MSO5000 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes

Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a MSO5000 Oscilloscope:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Tektronix_DPO7000 import TektronixDPO7000xx

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = TektronixDPO7000xx("oscilloscope", "TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Print the available channels
print(oscilloscope.channel.names)

# Set the time per division for channel 1
oscilloscope.channel1.scale(0.1)  # Set to 0.1 seconds per division

# Acquire a waveform from channel 1
waveform = oscilloscope.channel1.waveform()

# Plot the waveform
waveform.plot()

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

This script connects to the oscilloscope using the IP address "192.168.1.1" and creates an instance of the `TektronixDPO7000xx` driver. It then prints the names of the available channels, sets the time per division for channel 1 to 0.1 seconds, acquires a waveform from channel 1, and plots the waveform. Finally, it closes the connection to the oscilloscope.
