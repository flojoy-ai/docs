## Connect to the HDO4000A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


<Tabs>
<TabItem value="Instrumentkit" label="Instrumentkit">

To connect to a HDO4000A Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = ik.teledyne.MAUI.open_visa("TCPIP0::192.168.0.10::INSTR")

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.run()
print(oscilloscope.trigger_state)

# Close the connection
oscilloscope.close()
```

This code imports the `instrumentkit` module and uses the `open_visa` function from the `ik.teledyne.MAUI` module to connect to the oscilloscope. The IP address "192.168.0.10" should be replaced with the actual IP address of your oscilloscope.

After connecting to the oscilloscope, you can perform operations on it. In this example, the `run` method is called to start the trigger and the `trigger_state` property is printed to display the current trigger state.

Finally, the `close` method is called to close the connection to the oscilloscope.

Note: This code assumes that you have already installed the `instrumentkit` package and its dependencies.
