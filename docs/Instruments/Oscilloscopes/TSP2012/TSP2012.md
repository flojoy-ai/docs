The TPS2000 Series easily addresses the unique challenges that plague industrial power designers and technicians. You regularly confront high voltages and currents, and must often make potentially hazardous floating measurements. With the TPS2000 Series' power bundle (TPS2PBND), which includes the P5120 passive, high-voltage probes and TPS2PWR1 power measurement and analysis software, you can use a single instrument to make a broad range of measurements.

Easily evaluate these high voltages and currents, or debug power electronics control circuits, with differential voltages up to 600 VRMS CAT II (or 300 VRMS CAT III) floating. Accurately measure three-phase power and circuits with different low levels or ground references.

Quickly perform a broad range of power-specific measurements, such as switching loss, harmonic distortion measurements to the 50th harmonic, and dv/dt and di/dt cursor measurements.

## Connect to the TSP2012 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Qcodes

Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a TPS2012 Oscilloscope:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.TPS2012 import TPS2012

# Create an instance of the TPS2012 instrument
scope = TPS2012('scope', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
scope.connect()

# Print the instrument ID
print(scope.IDN())

# Set the horizontal scale to 1 ms/div
scope.horizontal_scale(1e-3)

# Set the trigger type to EDGE
scope.trigger_type('EDGE')

# Set the trigger source to CH1
scope.trigger_source('CH1')

# Start the acquisition
scope.run()

# Wait for the acquisition to complete
scope.wait_for_acquisition()

# Get the waveform data from channel 1
data = scope.channels.ch1.curvedata()

# Disconnect from the instrument
scope.disconnect()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual address of your TPS2012 Oscilloscope.
