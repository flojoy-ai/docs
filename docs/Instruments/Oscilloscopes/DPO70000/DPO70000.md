## Connect to the DPO70000 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)

<TabItem value="Instrumentkit" label="Instrumentkit">

To connect to a DPO70000 Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the `DPO70000` class from the `instruments.tektronix.dpo70000` module. Here's an example Python script that demonstrates how to connect to the oscilloscope:

```python
from instruments.tektronix.dpo70000 import DPO70000

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = DPO70000.open_gpibusb("/dev/ttyUSB0", 1)

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
# For example, you can query the instrument's identification
print(oscilloscope.query("*IDN?"))

# Close the connection to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

In this example, the `open_gpibusb` method is used to establish a connection to the oscilloscope. The first argument `"/dev/ttyUSB0"` is the device file for the GPIB-USB adapter, and the second argument `1` is the GPIB address of the oscilloscope.

After connecting, you can perform various operations on the oscilloscope using the `oscilloscope` object. For example, you can use the `query` method to send SCPI commands and retrieve the instrument's identification.

Finally, don't forget to close the connection to the oscilloscope using the `close` method to release any resources and terminate the connection.

<TabItem value="Qcodes" label="Qcodes">

Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a DPO70000 Oscilloscope:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Tektronix_DPO7000xx import TektronixDPO7000xx

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = TektronixDPO7000xx("oscilloscope", "TCPIP::1.2.3.4::INSTR")

# Print the available channels
print(oscilloscope.channel.names)

# Set the time per division for channel 1
oscilloscope.channel1.scale(0.1)

# Acquire a waveform from channel 1
waveform = oscilloscope.channel1.waveform()

# Plot the waveform
waveform.plot()

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

This script connects to the oscilloscope using the IP address "1.2.3.4" and creates an instance of the `TektronixDPO7000xx` driver. It then prints the names of the available channels, sets the time per division for channel 1 to 0.1, acquires a waveform from channel 1, and plots the waveform. Finally, it closes the connection to the oscilloscope.
