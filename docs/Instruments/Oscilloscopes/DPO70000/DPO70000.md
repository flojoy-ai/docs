## Connect to the DPO70000 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Instrumentkit

To connect to a DPO70000 oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following code:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the oscilloscope
tek = ik.tektronix.TekDPO70000.open_tcpip("192.168.0.2", 8888)

# Perform operations on the oscilloscope
# For example, read waveform from channel 0
[x, y] = tek.channel[0].read_waveform()

# Close the connection
tek.close()
```

This code connects to the oscilloscope at IP address "192.168.0.2" and port 8888 using the `open_tcpip` method of the `TekDPO70000` class. It then reads a waveform from channel 0 using the `read_waveform` method of the `Channel` class. Finally, it closes the connection using the `close` method.

### Qcodes

Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes to connect to a DPO70000 Oscilloscope:

```python
import qcodes as qc
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.tektronix.Tektronix_DPO7000xx import TektronixDPO7000xx

# Connect to the oscilloscope
oscilloscope = TektronixDPO7000xx("oscilloscope", "TCPIP::1.2.3.4::INSTR")

# Print the available channels
print(oscilloscope.channel.names)

# Set the time per division for channel 1
oscilloscope.channel1.scale(0.1)

# Acquire a waveform from channel 1
waveform = oscilloscope.channel1.waveform()

# Plot the waveform
waveform.plot()

# Disconnect from the oscilloscope
oscilloscope.close()
```

This script connects to the oscilloscope using the IP address "1.2.3.4" and creates an instance of the `TektronixDPO7000xx` driver. It then prints the names of the available channels, sets the time per division for channel 1 to 0.1, acquires a waveform from channel 1, and plots the waveform. Finally, it closes the connection to the oscilloscope.
