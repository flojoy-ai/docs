## Connect to the TDS510A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Instrumentkit

To connect to a TDS510A Oscilloscope using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from instrumentkit import tektronix

# Connect to the oscilloscope
tek = tektronix.TekTDS5xx.open_tcpip('192.168.0.2', 8888)

# Access the channels and read waveform data
[x, y] = tek.channel[0].read_waveform()

# Print the waveform data
print(x)
print(y)
```

This script imports the `tektronix` module from Instrumentkit and uses the `open_tcpip` method to connect to the TDS510A Oscilloscope at the specified IP address and port number.

Then, it accesses the first channel of the oscilloscope using `tek.channel[0]` and calls the `read_waveform` method to read the waveform data from that channel. The waveform data is stored in the `x` and `y` variables.

Finally, the script prints the `x` and `y` variables, which contain the waveform data.

Note: Make sure to replace `'192.168.0.2'` with the actual IP address of your TDS510A Oscilloscope.
