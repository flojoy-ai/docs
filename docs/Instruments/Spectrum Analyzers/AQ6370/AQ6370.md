## Connect to the AQ6370 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)


### Instrumentkit

To connect to a Yokogawa AQ6370 Spectrum Analyzer using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Yokogawa AQ6370 Spectrum Analyzer
osa = ik.yokogawa.Yokogawa6370.open_visa('TCPIP0:192.168.0.35')

# Access the properties and methods of the Yokogawa AQ6370 Spectrum Analyzer
print(osa.id)
print(osa.start_wl)
print(osa.stop_wl)
osa.start_sweep()
data = osa.data()
wavelength = osa.wavelength()

# Close the connection to the Yokogawa AQ6370 Spectrum Analyzer
osa.close()
```

This script imports the `instrumentkit` module and uses the `open_visa` method of the `Yokogawa6370` class to connect to the Yokogawa AQ6370 Spectrum Analyzer using the VISA address `'TCPIP0:192.168.0.35'`.

You can then access the properties and methods of the Yokogawa AQ6370 Spectrum Analyzer object (`osa`). For example, you can print the identification (`id`) of the device, get the start and stop wavelengths (`start_wl` and `stop_wl`), start a sweep (`start_sweep`), and retrieve the data and wavelength values (`data` and `wavelength`).

Finally, you can close the connection to the Yokogawa AQ6370 Spectrum Analyzer using the `close` method.
