## Connect to the AQ6370 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)

<TabItem value="Instrumentkit" label="Instrumentkit">

To connect to a Yokogawa AQ6370 Spectrum Analyzer using Instrumentkit, you can use the following Python script:

```python
import instrumentkit as ik

# Connect to the Yokogawa AQ6370 Spectrum Analyzer
osa = ik.yokogawa.Yokogawa6370.open_visa('TCPIP0:192.168.0.35')

# Access the properties and methods of the instrument
print(osa.id)
print(osa.start_wl)
print(osa.stop_wl)
osa.start_sweep()
data = osa.data()
wavelength = osa.wavelength()

# Close the connection to the instrument
osa.close()
```

This script imports the `instrumentkit` module and uses the `open_visa` method of the `Yokogawa6370` class to connect to the Yokogawa AQ6370 Spectrum Analyzer. The IP address 'TCPIP0:192.168.0.35' is passed as an argument to the `open_visa` method to specify the instrument's address.

Once connected, you can access the properties and methods of the instrument. In the example script, the `id` property is printed to get the identification of the device. The `start_wl` and `stop_wl` properties are also printed to get the start and stop wavelengths of the spectrum analysis.

The `start_sweep` method is called to trigger the spectrum analysis. The `data` and `wavelength` methods are used to retrieve the trace data and wavelength data, respectively.

Finally, the `close` method is called to close the connection to the instrument.

Note: Make sure to replace 'TCPIP0:192.168.0.35' with the actual IP address of your Yokogawa AQ6370 Spectrum Analyzer.
