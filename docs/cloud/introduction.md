title: Flojoy Cloud Clients
---

## Welcome

Welcome to the Flojoy Cloud API documentation! Here you can find all the information you need to get started with Flojoy's API.

The cloud REST API docs are hosted at [rest.flojoy.ai](https://rest.flojoy.ai).

## Getting Started

You must first sign up for a Flojoy Cloud account [here](https://cloud.flojoy.ai/).

Then, you will be able to generate an API key, under Settings.

This key will be used every time you interact with our RESTful API.

## Usage Introduction

Before we start, let's take a look at the overall structure of Flojoy Cloud.

When you use the cloud, you will be interacting with the following 2 concepts:

- DataContainer
- Measurement

Data container is something we are familiar with when using Flojoy Studio. When we pass data between nodes, they are passed as a data container.

Measurement is simply a collection of data containers. This helps you to group data containers together for analysis later.

## Clients

Currently there are two clients written for the REST API: Python and MATLABÂ®.

You can find examples of some usages on the next page.
