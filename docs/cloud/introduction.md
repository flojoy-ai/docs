title: Flojoy Cloud Clients
---

## Welcome

Welcome to the Flojoy Cloud API documentation! Here you can find all the information you need to get started with Flojoy's API.

The cloud REST API docs are hosted at [rest.flojoy.ai](https://rest.flojoy.ai).

## Getting Started

You must first sign up for a Flojoy Cloud account [here](https://cloud.flojoy.ai/).

Then, you will be able to generate an API key, under Settings.

This key will be used every time you interact with our RESTful API.

## Usage Introduction

Before we start, let's take a look at the overall structure of Flojoy Cloud.

When you use the cloud, you will be interacting with the following 2 concepts:

- Data container
- Measurement

Let us understand them through a simple analogy:

Imagine Flojoy Cloud as your email inbox like Gmail or Outlook. Your email inbox is able to receive emails, just like how Flojoy Cloud is able to receive data containers.

When we start to receive lots of emails, from friends, work, school, etc. Your inbox starts to get overwhelming. This is when you start using the folder feature to group similar emails into a specific folder.

The same thing applies to Flojoy Cloud. When you start to have lots of data containers (like emails), you want to group them together and put them into a measurement (like a folder). For example, you can create a measurement for each experiment you are doing with Flojoy Studio, then streaming the data container of each experiment to its respective measurement.

## Clients

Currently there are two clients written for the REST API: Python and Matlab.

You can find examples of some usages on the next page.
