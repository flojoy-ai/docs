## Electronic Loads 

<details> 
<summary>Category Description</summary> 
An electronic load is a test instrument designed to sink current and absorb power out of a power source. If a power supply is used to power a device, an electronic load is used to test the power supply by emulating the device under test (DUT). Power supplies and electronic loads are complementary test equipment. The power supply tests electronic circuits under specific sourcing conditions. The electronic load tests the energy sources or energy conversion blocks under specific loading constraints. An electronic load is a programmable instrument that offers the user various modes of control such as constant voltage (CV), constant current (CC), constant power (CP) or constant resistance (CR).
