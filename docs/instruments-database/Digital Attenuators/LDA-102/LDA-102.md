## Connect to the LDA-102 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)

<TabItem value="Flojoy" label="Flojoy" className="flojoy-instrument-tabs">

<NodeCardCollection category='DIGITAL_ATTENUATORS' manufacturer='VAUNIX'></NodeCardCollection>

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="QCodes Community" label="QCodes Community">

Here is an example Python script that uses Qcodes Community to connect to a LDA-102 Digital Attenuator:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.vaunix.LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-102 Digital Attenuator
lda = LDA('lda', serial_number=55102, dll_path='path/to/dll')

# Add the LDA to the station
station.add_component(lda)

# Print the IDN of the LDA
print(lda.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
lda.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the LDA
lda.close()
```

Note: Replace `'path/to/dll'` with the actual path to the directory that contains the Vaunix LDA DLL (`VNX_atten.dll` for 32-bit Windows or `VNX_atten64.dll` for 64-bit Windows).
This script creates a `Station` object to hold the instruments. It then connects to the LDA-102 Digital Attenuator using the `LDA` driver from the Qcodes Community. The LDA is added to the station, and its IDN information is printed. The attenuation is set to 10 dB, and finally, the connection to the LDA is closed.
