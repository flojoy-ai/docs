sidebar_label: LDA-802-32
description: The LDA-802-32 Digital Attenuator is a rack mounted 32-channel high dynamic range, bidirectional, 50 Ohm step attenuator. The LDA-802-32 provides 120 dB of attenuation control range from 200 to 8000 MHz with a step size of 0.1 dB. The attenuators are easily programmable for fixed attenuation, swept attenuation ramps and user defined fading profiles directly from the included Graphical User Interface (GUI). Alternatively, for users wishing to develop their own interface, Vaunix supplies LabVIEW drivers, Windows API DLL files, Linux drivers, Python examples and much more.

## Connect to the LDA-802-32 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)

import NodeCardCollection from '@site/src/components/NodeCardCollection';

<Tabs>

To connect to a LDA-802-32 Digital Attenuator using Qcodes Community, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes_contrib_drivers.drivers.Vaunix_LDA import LDA

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the LDA-802-32 Digital Attenuator
attenuator = LDA('attenuator', serial_number=80232)

# Add the attenuator to the station
station.add_component(attenuator)

# Print the IDN of the attenuator
print(attenuator.get_idn())

# Set the attenuation to 10 dB
attenuator.attenuation(10)

# Close the connection to the attenuator
attenuator.close()
```

This script creates a `Station` object to hold the instruments. It then connects to the LDA-802-32 Digital Attenuator using the `LDA` driver from the `qcodes_contrib_drivers` package. The attenuator is added to the station, and its IDN is printed. The attenuation is set to 10 dB, and finally, the connection to the attenuator is closed.
