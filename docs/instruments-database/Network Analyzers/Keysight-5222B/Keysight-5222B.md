## Connect to the Keysight 5222B in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="QCodes" label="QCodes">

To connect to a Keysight 5222B Network Analyzer using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes import Station
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_5222B import Keysight_5222B

# Create a station to hold the instruments
station = Station()

# Connect to the Keysight 5222B Network Analyzer
na = Keysight_5222B('na', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR')
station.add_component(na)

# Now you can use the `na` object to control the network analyzer
# For example, you can set the start and stop frequencies
na.start(1e6)  # Set the start frequency to 1 MHz
na.stop(1e9)  # Set the stop frequency to 1 GHz

# You can also read measurements from the network analyzer
data = na.traces[0].magnitude()  # Read the magnitude of the first trace

# Print the data
print(data)

# Close the connection to the network analyzer
na.close()
```

Note: Replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::inst0::INSTR'` with the actual IP address or VISA resource string of your Keysight 5222B Network Analyzer.
