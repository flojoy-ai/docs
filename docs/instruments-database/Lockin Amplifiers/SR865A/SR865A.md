## Connect to the SR865A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)

<TabItem value="QCodes" label="QCodes">

To connect to a SR865A Lockin Amplifier using Qcodes, you can use the following code:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.stanford_research.SR865A import SR865A

# Create an instance of the SR865A driver
address = "TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR"
lockin = SR865A("lockin", address)

# Connect to the instrument
lockin.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to perform various operations
# For example, you can get the X and Y values
x = lockin.X()
y = lockin.Y()

# You can also set the frequency and amplitude
lockin.frequency(1000)  # Set the frequency to 1000 Hz
lockin.amplitude(0.1)   # Set the amplitude to 0.1 V


# Disconnect from the instrument
lockin.disconnect()
```

This code creates an instance of the `SR865A` driver and connects to the lock-in amplifier using the specified address (`TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR`). You can then use the `lockin` object to interact with the instrument by calling its methods or accessing its parameters. Finally, you can disconnect from the instrument using the `disconnect()` method.
