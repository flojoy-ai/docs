## Connect to the SR 860 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="PyMeasure" label="PyMeasure">


```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments.sr860 import SR860

# Create a VISA adapter for the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("GPIB0::1::INSTR")

# Connect to the SR860 Lock-in Amplifier
lockin = SR860(adapter)

# Perform operations with the lock-in amplifier
x_value = lockin.x
y_value = lockin.y
magnitude = lockin.magnitude
theta = lockin.theta

# Print the values
print("X value:", x_value)
print("Y value:", y_value)
print("Magnitude:", magnitude)
print("Theta:", theta)

# Disconnect from the lock-in amplifier
lockin.disconnect()
```

This script connects to the SR 860 Lock-in Amplifier using a VISA adapter and performs measurements of the X value, Y value, magnitude, and theta. The values are then printed to the console. Finally, the script disconnects from the lock-in amplifier.
