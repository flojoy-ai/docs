description: The SG380 Series RF Signal Generators use a unique, innovative architecture (Rational Approximation Frequency Synthesis) to deliver ultra-high frequency resolution (1 µHz), excellent phase noise, and versatile modulation capabilities (AM, FM, ØM, pulse modulation and sweeps) at a fraction of the cost of competing designs. The standard models produce sine waves from DC to 2.025 GHz (SG382), 4.05 GHz (SG384) and 6.075 GHz (SG386).

## Connect to the SG 380 in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="PyMeasure" label="PyMeasure">

```python
from pymeasure.adapters import VISAAdapter
from pymeasure.instruments import SG380

# Create a VISA adapter for communication with the instrument
adapter = VISAAdapter("TCPIP::192.168.1.1::INSTR")

# Create an instance of the SG380 RF Signal Generator
sg = SG380(adapter)

# Connect to the instrument
sg.open()

# Access the properties and methods of the instrument
frequency = sg.frequency
print("Current frequency: {} Hz".format(frequency))

sg.frequency = 1E6
print("Frequency set to 1 MHz")

mod_type = sg.mod_type
print("Current modulation type: {}".format(mod_type))

sg.mod_type = 'AM'
print("Modulation type set to AM")

# Close the connection to the instrument
sg.close()
```

This script demonstrates how to connect to an SG380 RF Signal Generator using Pymeasure. It creates a VISA adapter for communication, creates an instance of the SG380 instrument, opens the connection, and then accesses and sets various properties of the instrument. Finally, it closes the connection.
