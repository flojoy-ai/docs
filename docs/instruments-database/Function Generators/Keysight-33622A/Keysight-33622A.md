## Connect to the Keysight 33622A in Python

[Read our guide for turning Python scripts into Flojoy nodes.](https://docs.flojoy.ai/custom-nodes/creating-custom-node/)
<Tabs>
<TabItem value="QCodes" label="QCodes">

To connect to a Keysight 33622A Function Generator using Qcodes, you can use the following Python script:

```python
from qcodes.instrument_drivers.Keysight.Keysight_33XXX import WaveformGenerator_33XXX

# Create an instance of the instrument
instrument = WaveformGenerator_33XXX('my_instrument', 'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR')

# Connect to the instrument
instrument.connect()

# Now you can use the instrument to control the function generator
# For example, to set the frequency of channel 1 to 1 MHz:
instrument.ch1.frequency(1e6)

# To turn on the output of channel 1:
instrument.ch1.output('ON')

# To disconnect from the instrument:
instrument.disconnect()
```

Note that you need to replace `'TCPIP0::192.168.1.1::INSTR'` with the actual VISA resource name of your instrument.
