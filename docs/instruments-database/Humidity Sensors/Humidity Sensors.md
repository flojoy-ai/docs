## Humidity Sensors 

<details> 
<summary>Category Description</summary> 
A humidity sensor is an electronic device that measures the humidity in its environment and converts its findings into a corresponding electrical signal. Humidity sensors vary widely in size and functionality; some humidity sensors can be found in handheld devices (such as smartphones), while others are integrated into larger embedded systems (such as air quality monitoring systems). Humidity sensors are commonly used in the meteorology, medical, automobile, HVAC and manufacturing industries.
