## HARDWARE required:

- A stepper motor (we used a [Nema 15-23](https://www.pololu.com/category/140/nema-23-stepper-motors))
- A Tic motor driver (we used a [TIC T825](https://www.pololu.com/product/3131), but any Tic driver should work).
- A power supply with enough power to run the driver and motor. (You'll need to set up the current value depending on your motor and your driver)
- Connection cables (USB, power supply leads, etc)
