In this example, the [`CAMERA`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/INSTRUMENTS/WEB_CAM/CAMERA/CAMERA.py) node takes and returns a picture if a USB camera is connected to the computer.

The [`IMSHOW`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/VISUALIZERS/PLOTLY/TABLE/TABLE.py) node then displays the image taken by the camera, and the the [`END`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/TERMINATORS/END/END.py) node terminates the process.
