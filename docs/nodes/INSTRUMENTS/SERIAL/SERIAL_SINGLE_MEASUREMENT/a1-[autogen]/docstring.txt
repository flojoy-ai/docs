The SERIAL_SINGLE_MEASUREMENT Node takes a single reading of data from an Ardunio,
or a similar serial device.

For example you can record temperature following this tutorial:

https://learn.adafruit.com/thermistor/using-a-thermistor

with Serial.println(steinhart) as the only line printing.

It is important that the last line Arduino is returning is the
data with a new line at the end (i.e. println()).

The other lines must be returned with print()
with print(",") between each line.

For example:

print(reading0)
print(",")
println(reading1)

The SERIAL_SINGLE_MEASUREMENT receive data from the arduino serial console as a string and split
it using "," as separators. Then it returns the values measured in a list names reading.


Parameters :
------------
baudrate: Float
    Baud rate for the serial communication.

comport: String
    Define the COM port on which the Serial device is connected
