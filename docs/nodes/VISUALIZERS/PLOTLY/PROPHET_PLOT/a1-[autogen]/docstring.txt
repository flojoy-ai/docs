The PROPHET_PLOT node plots the forecasted trend of the time series data that was passed in.
This is the output plotly graph from the "plot_plotly" function from "prophet.plot".
It expects as input the trained Prophet model from the PROPHET_PREDICT node.

 If "run_forecast" was True in that node, the forecasted dataframe will be available in "m" attribute of default input.
Otherwise, this will make the predictions on the raw dataframe (in which case it will be the "m" attribute of default input).

You can tell if that forecasted dataframe is available via the "extra" field of data input - "run_forecast", (data.extra["run_forecast"]).

Inputs
------
default : DataFrame
data : DataContainer

Parameters
----------
periods : int
    The number of periods out to predict.
    Only used if the node passed into this node (i.e. PROPHET_PREDICT) did NOT return the forecast.
    If the forecast was included in the DataContainer, this parameter will be ignored.

    Default = 365

Returns
-------
Plotly
