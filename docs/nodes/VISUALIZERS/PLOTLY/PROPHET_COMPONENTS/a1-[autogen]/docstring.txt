The PROPHET_COMPONENTS node plots the components of the prophet model trained

    in the PROPHET_PREDICT node. This is the output plotly graph from the
    `plot_components_plotly` function from `prophet.plot`

    It expects as input the trained Prophet model from the PROPHET_PREDICT node. If
    `run_forecast` was True in that node, the forecasted dataframe will be available
    here as the `m` dc_input attribute. Otherwise, this will make the predictions on
    the raw dataframe (which will be the `m` attribute in that case). You can tell
    out if that forecasted dataframe is available via the `extra` field "run_forecast"
    of the dc_input (`dc_inputs[0].extra["run_forecast"]`)

    Parameters
    ----------
    periods : int
        The number of periods out to predict. Only used if the node passed into this
        node (ie PROPHET_PREDICT) did NOT return the forecast. If the forecast was
        included in the DataContainer, this param will be ignored.

        Default 365

    Returns
    -------
    DataContainer of type "plotly" with the figure containing the plotted components
