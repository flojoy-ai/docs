title: SCATTER3D
description: In this example, we are simulating data from the PLOTLY_DATASET and DF_2_ORDEREDTRIPLE nodes and visualizing them with the SCATTER3D node. This creates a Plotly Scatter 3D visualization from the input nodes.

In this example, we are simulating data from the `PLOTLY_DATASET` and `DF_2_ORDEREDTRIPLE` nodes and visualizing them with the `SCATTER3D` node. This creates a Plotly Scatter 3D visualization from the input nodes.
