title: APPEND
description: In this example, an OrderedPair with random y values is generated and passed to a loop which uses the APPEND node to append a new random y value to the OrderedPair. The SCATTER node is updated with each loop, showing how the APPEND node works.

In this example, the `LINSPACE` and `RAND` nodes generate an `OrderedPair` with random y values. 

This array is then passed a loop which uses the `APPEND` node to append a new random y value to the `OrderedPair`.

The `SCATTER` node is updated with each loop, showing how the `APPEND` node works.
