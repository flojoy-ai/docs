This example shows a simple way to create a loop with Flojoy

To create a Loop, you'll need to place 3 mandatory nodes : 

The [`LOOP`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/LOOPS/LOOP/LOOP.py) node which will define the number of loops for the application. 

The [`GOTO`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/LOOPS/GOTO/GOTO.py) node which will define where the loop ends. This node takes a parameter called 'node_reference' in which you can choose where the loop starts again (Generally it's the [`LOOP`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/LOOPS/LOOP/LOOP.py) node).

Lastly, we have an [`END`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/TERMINATORS/END.py) node which is connected with end output of [`LOOP`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/LOOPS/LOOP/LOOP.py) node, which serves to terminate the program.

When these nodes are placed we can choose what we want to do inside the loop : 

In this very simple example app a random number is generated by the node ['RAND'](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/GENERATORS/SIMULATIONS/CONSTANT/CONSTANT.py) and multiplied with a constant defined by the user with the node [`CONSTANT`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/GENERATORS/SIMULATIONS/CONSTANT/CONSTANT.py). Finally the result is displayed with the visualization node [`BIG_NUMBER`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/VISUALIZERS/PLOTLY/BIG_NUMBER/BIG_NUMBER.py) and updated during each iteration of the loop.


 After each iteration, the [`LOOP`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/LOOPS/LOOP/LOOP.py) node checks if the remaining number of iterations is greater than zero. If so, it enqueues its body nodes again until the number of remaining iterations becomes zero. Finally, it enqueues the nodes connected to its end output (Generally the [`END`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/TERMINATORS/END.py) node).



The value is then passed to a [`LOOP`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/LOOPS/LOOP/LOOP.py) node, which, in turn, passes it to the nodes connected to its body output. The [`LOOP`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/LOOPS/LOOP/LOOP.py) node is a special node that takes a parameter called `num_loops`, indicating the number of iterations. In this example, we used 5 iterations, but the default value for this parameter is `-1`, meaning it will iterate infinitely. Each time the [`LOOP`](https://github.com/flojoy-io/nodes/blob/main/LOGIC_GATES/LOOPS/LOOP/LOOP.py) node is executed, it checks the remaining number of iterations and enqueues all nodes connected to its body output if there are more iterations to be performed.
