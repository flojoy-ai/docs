The CONDITIONAL node is a specialized node that compares two given Scalar inputs.
    We are planning to add support for more DataContainer types in the future.


    It then enqueues nodes connected with a "true" or "false" output based on the comparison result.

    Parameters
    ----------
    operator_type : select
        Specifies the type of comparison to be performed between the two inputs. The default value is ">=".
