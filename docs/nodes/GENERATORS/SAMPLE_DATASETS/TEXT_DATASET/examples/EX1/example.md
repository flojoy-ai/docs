In this example, the `TEXT_DATASET` node is used to load the `20 newsgroups` dataset. Only the training subset is selected, and the two categories that are loaded are `comp.graphics` and `alt.atheism`.

`REMOVE_HEADERS`, `REMOVE_FOOTERS`, and `REMOVE_QUOTES` are also set to `true` in order to remove the headers, footers, and quotes from the data.
