The BASIC_OSCILLATOR node is a combination of LINSPACE and SINE node.
    It is useful for generating signals as it will generate a waveform with
    sample rate and the time in seconds as parameters.
    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_rate: int
        How many samples taken during a second
    time: int
        The total amount of time of the signal

    Returns
    -------
        x: time domain
        y: generated signal
