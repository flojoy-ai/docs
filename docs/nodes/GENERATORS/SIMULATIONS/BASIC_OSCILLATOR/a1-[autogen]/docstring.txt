The BASIC_OSCILLATOR node is a combination of the LINSPACE and SINE nodes.

    It offers a more straightforward way to generate signals, with sample rate and the time in seconds as parameters, along with all the parameters in the SINE node.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_rate : float
        The number of samples that are taken in a second.
    time : float
        The total amount of time of the signal.
    waveform : select
        The waveform type of the wave.
    amplitude : float
        The amplitude of the wave.
    frequency : float
        The wave frequency in radians/2pi.
    offset : float
        The y axis offset of the function.
    phase : float
        The x axis offset of the function.

    Returns
    -------
    OrderedPair
        x: time domain
        y: generated signal
