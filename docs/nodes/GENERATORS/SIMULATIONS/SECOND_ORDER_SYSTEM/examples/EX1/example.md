title: SECOND_ORDER_SYSTEM
description: This example demonstrates an active PID controller for a mock non-linear system to be driven to a given setpoint using the SECOND_ORDER_SYSTEM node, which has a second order exponential function. This node is designed to be used in a Python loop. The data is appended as the loop progresses and written to memory.
