The description of that function is as follows:

    Compute the eigenvalues of a general matrix.

Main difference between `eigvals` and `eig`: the eigenvectors are not returned.

Parameters
----------
a : (..., M, M) array_like
    A complex- or real-valued matrix whose eigenvalues will be computed.

Returns
-------
DataContainer
    type 'ordered pair', 'scalar', or 'matrix'
