The SLOGDET node is based on a numpy or scipy function.

The description of that function is as follows:

    Compute the sign and (natural) logarithm of the determinant of an array.

    If an array has a very small or very large determinant, then a call to 'det' may overflow or underflow.

    This routine is more robust against such issues, because it computes the logarithm of the determinant rather than the determinant itself.

Parameters
----------
select_return : This function has returns multiple objects []'sign', 'logdet'].
    Select the desired one to return.
    See the respective function documents for descriptors.
a : (..., M, M) array_like
    Input array, has to be a square 2-D array.

Returns
-------
DataContainer
    type 'ordered pair', 'scalar', or 'matrix'
