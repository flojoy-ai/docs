The REMOTE_FILE node loads a remote file using an HTTP URL and converts it to a DataContainer class.

    Note: If both the file_url and default are not specified when file_type="Image", a default image will be loaded.

    For now, REMOTE_FILE only supports HTTP file URLs, in particular GCP URL (starting with gcp://). S3 URL (starting with s3://) and other bucket-like URLs are not supported.

    If the file url is not specified and the default input is not connected, or if the file url is not a valid URL, a ValueError is raised.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_url : str
        URL of the file to be loaded.
    default : Optional[TextBlob]
        If this input node is connected, the file URL will be taken from
        the output of the connected node.
        To be used in conjunction with batch processing.
    file_type : str
        Type of file to load, default = image.

    Returns
    -------
    Image|DataFrame
        Image for file_type 'image'.
        DataFrame for file_type 'json', 'csv', 'excel', 'xml'.
