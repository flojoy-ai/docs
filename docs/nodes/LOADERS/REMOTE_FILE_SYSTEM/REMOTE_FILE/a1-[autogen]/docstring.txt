The REMOTE_FILE node loads a remote file using an HTTP URL and converts it to a DataContainer class.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_url : str
        URL  the file to be loaded
    default   : Optional[TextBlob]
        If this input node is connected, the file URL will be taken from
        the output of the connected node. To be used in conjunction with batch processing
    file_type : str
        type of file to load, default = image

    Notes
    -----
    If both file_url and default are not specified when `file_type="Image"`, a default image will be loaded.

    REMOTE_FILE for now only supports HTTP file URLs, in particular GCP URL (starting with `gcp://`),
    S3 URL (starting with `s3://`)  and other bucket-like URLs are not supported.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        If the file url is not specified and the default input is not connected, a ValueError is raised.
        If the file url is not a valid URL, a ValueError is raised.

    Returns
    -------
    Image|DataFrame
        Image for file_type 'image'
        DataFrame for file_type 'json', 'csv', 'excel', 'xml'
