The BATCH_PROCESSOR node is designed to glob match a pattern in the given input directory.

    From here, in conjunction with a loop, we iterate
    over all the files found, and return each one by
    file path as a TextBlob. The TextBlob can be recognized as
    an optional input to the LOCAL_FILE node, which can
    then load the file at that path and return the appropriate
    datatype.

    Parameters
    ----------
    current_iteration : Scalar
        This is the input from the LOOP_INDEX node that determines
        whether we need to initialize this routine or not.
    default_params : DefaultParams
        This provides the node_id so that we can identify which
        object in SmallMemory to pull (for example, unique identification
        of this node if there are multiple BATCH_PROCESSOR nodes).
    directory_path : str
        The directory in which we should match the pattern to find the files.
    pattern : str
        The glob pattern to match.
        If not provided, all files in the directory are returned.
        The current implementation supports recursion and double wildcard matching.
    refresh : bool
        A switching parameter that refreshes the cache of files. If a separate
        programme is expected to continuously write new files of interest to the
        directory, this flag will enable the update of the new files for processing.

    Returns
    -------
    fname : TextBlob
        The file name on the current iteration.
    n_files : Scalar
        The total number of files matched by the pattern in the given directory.
