This example demonstrates how to batch load many `TIFF` images from within a directory, and process them each sequentially.

**NB:** You will need to edit the file paths in the `BATCH_PROCESSOR` nodes to reflect the path of the assets in your current installation of Flojoy Studio. They are found in the `assets` directory where this node is maintained.
