This app demonstrates how to batch load many `TIF` images from within a directory, and process them each sequentially.

*Nota bene* that you will need to edit the file paths in the `BATCH_PROCESSOR` nodes to reflect the path of the assets in your current installation of Flojoy Studio. They are found in the `assets` directory
where this node is maintained.
