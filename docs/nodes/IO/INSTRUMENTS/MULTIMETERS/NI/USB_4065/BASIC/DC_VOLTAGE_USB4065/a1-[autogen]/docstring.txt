The DC_VOLTAGE_USB4065 node reads the DC voltage from a USB-4065.

    The USB-4065 is a NI (National Instruments) multimeter. It is possible that
    the node will work with other NI DMMs (digital multimeters) such as the
    4070 and 4080 series.

    This instrument will likely only be compatible with Windows systems due to
    NI driver availablity. To use the instrument you must install the runtime:

    You must also find the address/resource name for the instrument. You can
    find this using the NI MAX programming which can be downloaded when
    installing the drivers.
