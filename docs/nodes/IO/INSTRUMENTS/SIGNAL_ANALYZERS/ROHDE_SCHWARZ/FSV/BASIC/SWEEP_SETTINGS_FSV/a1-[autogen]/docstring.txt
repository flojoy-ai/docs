The SWEEP_SETTINGS_FSV node sets sweep settings for a FSV.

    Note that span/center and start/stop can be used equivalently if:
    start = center - (span / 2) and stop = center + (span / 2).

    Requires a CONNECTION_FSV node at the start of the app to connect with
    the instrument. The VISA address will then be listed under 'connection'.

    This node should also work with compatible R&S network analyzers.

    Parameters

    connection: VisaConnection
        The VISA address (requires the CONNECTION_FSV node).
    span_or_range: select

    center: float

    span: float

    start: float
        The start point of the x axis, in Hz.
    stop: float
        The end point of the x axis, in Hz.
    sweep_type: select
        How the FSV sweeps along the x axis range.
    counts: int
        Number of sweeps to do, (average optional in INIT_SWEEP_FSV).
