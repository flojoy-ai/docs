The CONNECTION_2000 node connects Flojoy to an available Picoscope.

    If more than one P2000 oscilloscope is available, the first one connected
    to the PC will likely be chosen. If you need specific device selection,
    please contact us at: https://www.flojoy.ai/contact-sales.

    Note the P2000 nodes require a device specific driver/SDK downloaded from:
    https://www.picotech.com/downloads.
