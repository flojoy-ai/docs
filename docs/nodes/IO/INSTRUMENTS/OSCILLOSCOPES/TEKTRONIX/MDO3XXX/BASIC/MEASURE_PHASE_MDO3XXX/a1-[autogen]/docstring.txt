The MEASURE_PHASE_MDO3XXX node measures the phase between two channels.

    If the "VISA_address" parameter is not specified the VISA_index will be
    used to find the address. The LIST_VISA node can be used to show the
    indicies of all available VISA instruments.

    This node should also work with compatible Tektronix scopes (untested):
    MDO4xxx, MSO4xxx, and DPO4xxx.

    channel2: int
