The EXTRACT_TRACE_MDO3XXX node extracts the trace from an MDO3xxx oscilloscope.

    The number of points in the x axis is defined by x_length and length_type
    parameters. A length_type of pixels and a x_length of 5000 will result in
    a trace with 5000 points. A length_type of nanoseconds instead results in
    a trace with a length of defined by the number of (nano)seconds.

    If the "VISA_address" parameter is not specified the VISA_index will be
    used to find the address. The LIST_VISA node can be used to show the
    indicies of all available VISA instruments.

    This node should also work with compatible Tektronix scopes (untested):
    MDO4xxx, MSO4xxx, and DPO4xxx.

    Parameters
    ----------
    VISA_address: str
        The VISA address to query.
    VISA_index: int
        The address will be found from LIST_VISA node list with this index.
    num_channels: int
        The number of channels on the instrument that are currently in use.
    x_length: int
        The length of the trace to extract.
    length_type: select
        The units of the length specified in x_length: nanoseconds or pixels.

    Returns
    -------
    DataContainer
        OrderedPair: The trace of the oscilloscope is returned.
