The TRIGGER_CHANNEL_MDO3XXX node sets the triggering channel (or queries it).

    If the "VISA_address" parameter is not specified the VISA_index will be
    used to find the address. The LIST_VISA node can be used to show the
    indicies of all available VISA instruments.

    This node should also work with compatible Tektronix scopes (untested):
    MDO4xxx, MSO4xxx, and DPO4xxx.

    VISA_address: str
        The VISA address to query.
    VISA_index: int
        The address will be found from LIST_VISA node list with this index.
    num_channels: int

    channel: int
        The channel to set as the triggering channel (used if setting).

        Whether to query or set the triggering channel.
