The MEASUREMENTS_MDO3XXX node extracts waveform measurements from an MDO3XXX oscilloscope.

    This node can select from three different waveform measurements:
    frequency, period, and amplitude. Also available are 5 statistic modes:
    instant, mean, max, min, and stdev where instant is a single measurement
    and stdev is the standard deviation of the mean.

    Units are in seconds, Hz, and V for frequency, period, and amplitude respectively.

    If the "VISA_address" parameter is not specified the VISA_index will be
    used to find the address. The LIST_VISA node can be used to show the
    indicies of all available VISA instruments.

    This node should also work with compatible Tektronix scopes (untested):
    MDO4xxx, MSO4xxx, and DPO4xxx.

    Parameters
    ----------
    VISA_address: str
        The VISA address to query.
    VISA_index: int
        The address will be found from LIST_VISA node list with this index.
    num_channels: int
        The number of channels on the instrument that are currently in use.
    measurement: str
        The measurement to extract from the scope.
    statistic: str
        The statistic mode to use for the measurement.

    Returns
    -------
    DataContainer
        Scalar: The waveform measurement in the selected statistic mode.
