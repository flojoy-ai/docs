The TRIGGER_LEVEL_MDO3XXX node sets the trigger voltage (or queries it).

    The trigger voltage is the level at which an oscilloscope will find the
    start of a signal.

    Requires a CONNECTION_MDO3XXX node at the start of the app to connect with
    the instrument. The VISA address will then be listed under 'connection'.

    This node should also work with compatible Tektronix scopes (untested):
    MDO4xxx, MSO4xxx, and DPO4xxx.

    Parameters
    ----------
    connection: VisaConnection
        The VISA address (requires the CONNECTION_MDO3XXX node).
    trigger_volts: float
        The voltage to set the triggering level to.
    query_set: str
        Whether to query or set the triggering voltage.

    Returns
    -------
    DataContainer
        Scalar: The triggering voltage.
