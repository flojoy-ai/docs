The TRIGGER_LEVEL_MDO3XXX node sets the trigger voltage (or queries it).

    The trigger voltage is the level at which an oscilloscope will find the
    start of a signal.

    If the "VISA_address" parameter is not specified the VISA_index will be
    used to find the address. The LIST_VISA node can be used to show the
    indicies of all available VISA instruments.

    This node should also work with compatible Tektronix scopes (untested):
    MDO4xxx, MSO4xxx, and DPO4xxx.

    Parameters
    ----------
    VISA_address: str
        The VISA address to query.
    VISA_index: int
        The address will be found from LIST_VISA node list with this index.
    num_channels: int
        The number of channels on the instrument that are currently in use.
    trigger_volts: float
        The voltage to set the triggering level to.
    query_set: str
        Whether to query or set the triggering voltage.

    Returns
    -------
    DataContainer
        Scalar: The triggering voltage.
