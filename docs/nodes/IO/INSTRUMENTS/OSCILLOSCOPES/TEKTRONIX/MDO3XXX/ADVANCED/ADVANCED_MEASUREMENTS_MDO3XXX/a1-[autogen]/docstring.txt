The ADVANCED_MEASUREMENTS_MDO3XXX node extracts waveform measurements from an MDO3xxx oscilloscope.

    This node is similar to MEASUREMENTS_MDO3XXX node but more measurements
    are availble. The available measurements are as follows:

    amplitude, area, burst, carea, cmean, crms, delay, distduty, extinctdb,
    extinctpct, extinctratio, eyeheight, eyewidth, fall, frequency, high, hits,
    low, maximum, mean, median, minimum, ncross, nduty, novershoot, nwidth,
    pbase, pcross, pctcross, pduty, peakhits, period, phase, pk2pk, pkpkjitter,
    pkpknoise, povershoot, ptop, pwidth, qfactor, rise, rms, rmsjitter,
    rmsnoise, sigma1, sigma2, sigma3, sixsigmajit, snratio, stddev, undefined,
    waveforms

    Also available are 5 statistic modes:
    instant, mean, max, min, and stdev where instant is a single measurement
    and stdev is the standard deviation of the mean.

    If the "VISA_address" parameter is not specified the VISA_index will be
    used to find the address. The LIST_VISA node can be used to show the
    indicies of all available VISA instruments.

    This node should also work with compatible Tektronix scopes (untested):
    MDO4xxx, MSO4xxx, and DPO4xxx.

    Parameters
    ----------
    VISA_address: str
        The VISA address to query.
    VISA_index: int
        The address will be found from LIST_VISA node list with this index.
    num_channels: int
        The number of channels on the instrument that are currently in use.

    Returns
    -------
    DataContainer
        OrderedPair: The trace of the oscilloscope is
