The VERTICAL_AXIS_DS1074Z node changes the vertical axis for the DS1074Z.

    Both the scale and offset can be changed. The scale sets the size
    of one section. The full window is 12 times the scale. The offset and scale
    setting will be rounded up to the nearest available setting by the DS1074Z.

    If 'query_set' is set to query the trigger settings will be queried and
    left unchanged.

    Requires a CONNECTION_DS1074Z node at the start of the app to connect with
    the instrument. The VISA address will then be listed under 'connection'.

    This node should also work with compatible DS1000Z oscilloscopes
