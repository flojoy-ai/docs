The BURST_MODE_33510B node is used to turn the Burst mode on or off.

    You can set various settings for the triggering of the bursts as well.
    The burst mode is way to have signals come in "bursts" that are triggered
    externally or with a timer for instance.

    Requires a CONNECTION_33510B node at the start of the app to connect with
    the instrument. The VISA address will then be listed under 'connection'.

    This node should also work with compatible Keysight 33XXX wavefunction
    generators (although they are untested).
