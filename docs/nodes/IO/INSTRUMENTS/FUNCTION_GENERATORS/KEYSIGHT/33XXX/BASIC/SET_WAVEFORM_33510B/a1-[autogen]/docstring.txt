The SET_WAVEFORM_33510B node is used to set waveform settings for a 33510B.

    The Keysight 33510B has a variety of waveform settings available.

    If the "VISA_address" parameter is not specified the VISA_index will be
    used to find the address. The LIST_VISA node can be used to show the
    indicies of all available VISA instruments.

    This node should also work with compatible Keysight 33XXX wavefunction
    generators (although they are untested).

    Parameters
    ----------
    VISA_address: str
        The VISA address to query.
    VISA_index: int
        The address will be found from LIST_VISA node list with this index.
    on_off: str
        Whether to turn the waveform generation to on or off.
    query_set: str
        Whether to query or set the waveform.
    channel: str
        The channel to set or query.
    waveform: str
        The type of waveform to use.
    frequency: float
        The voltage of the waveform to set, in Hz.
    amplitude: float
        The voltage of the waveform to set.
    amplitude_unit: str
        The voltage unit to set the waveform to.
    phase: float
        The phase to set the waveform to, in degrees.
    offset: float
        The voltage offset to set the waveform to, in volts.
    ramp_symmetry: float
        The ramp symmetry if the RAMP waveform is used, in percent.
    pulse_width: float
        The pulse width in nanoseconds if the PULS waveform is used.

    Returns
    -------
    DataContainer
        Scalar: The waveform measurement in the selected statistic mode.
