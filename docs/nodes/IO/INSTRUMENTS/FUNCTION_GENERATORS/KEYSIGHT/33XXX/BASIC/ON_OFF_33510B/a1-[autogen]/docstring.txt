The ON_OFF_33510B node is used to turn the output on or off.

    If the "VISA_address" parameter is not specified the VISA_index will be
    used to find the address. The LIST_VISA node can be used to show the
    indicies of all available VISA instruments.

    This node should also work with compatible Keysight 33XXX wavefunction
    generators (although they are untested).

    Parameters
    ----------
    VISA_address: str
        The VISA address to query.
    VISA_index: int
        The address will be found from LIST_VISA node list with this index.
    on_off: str
        Whether to turn the waveform generation to on or off.
    channel: str
        The channel to turn on or off.

    Returns
    -------
    DataContainer
        TextBlob: ON or OFF depending on on_off value.
