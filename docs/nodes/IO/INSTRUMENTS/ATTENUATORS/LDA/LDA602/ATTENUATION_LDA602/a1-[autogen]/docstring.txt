The ATTENUATION_LDA602 node sets or queries the attenuation for the LDA-602 Digital Attenuator.

    When setting the attenuation, the attenuation is then queried to ensure
    the attenuation was set correctly.
    The attenuation is rounded to the nearest 0.5 dB.

    This node should also work with compatible LDA attenuators (untested).
