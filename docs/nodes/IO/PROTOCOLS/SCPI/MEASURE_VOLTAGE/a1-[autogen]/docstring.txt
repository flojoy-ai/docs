    Inputs
    ------
    default: TextBlob
        A dummy TextBlob DataContainer - likely connected to the output of the OPEN_SERIAL node. This dummy input is intended to connect to the OPEN_SERIAL output to ensure that OPEN_SERIAL is executed first.

    Parameters

    connection: Serial
        The open serial connection with the instrument.

    Returns
    -------
    Scalar|TextBlob
        The measured voltage as a Scalar or an exception error as a TextBlob.
