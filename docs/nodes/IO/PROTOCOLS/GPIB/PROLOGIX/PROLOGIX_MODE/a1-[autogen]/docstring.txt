The PROLOGIX_MODE node sets the mode of the Prologix USB-to-GPIB controller - 1 for CONTROLLER mode and 0 for DEVICE mode.

    From the Prologix manual:

    In Controller mode, the GPIB-USB Controller acts as the Controller-In-Charge (CIC)
    on the GPIB bus. When the controller receives a command over the USB port
    terminated by the USB terminator – CR (ASCII 13) or LF (ASCII 10) – it addresses the 
    GPIB instrument at the currently specified address (See ++addr command) to listen, and
    passes along the received data. 

    In Device mode, Prologix GPIB-USB Controller acts as another peripheral on the GPIB
    bus. In this mode, the controller can act as a GPIB TALKER or GPIB LISTENER
    only. Since Prologix GPIB-USB Controller is not the Controller-In-Charge while in this
    mode, it expects to receive commands from a GPIB controller. When Device mode is
    enabled Prologix GPIB-USB controller configures itself as a GPIB Listener. All data
    received by the controller over the GPIB port is passed along to the USB port without
    buffering. 

    Inputs
    ------
    default: DataContainer
        Any DataContainer - likely connected to the output of the OPEN_SERIAL node.

    Parameters
    ----------
    connection: Serial
        The open serial connection with the instrument.

    Returns
    -------
    TextBlob
        Response from the Prologix USB-to-GPIB controller.
