The TRIM_MEAN node is based on a numpy or scipy function.

    The description of that function is as follows:

        Return the mean of an array after trimming distribution from both tails.

        If `proportiontocut` = 0.1, slices off 'leftmost' and 'rightmost' 10% of scores.
        The input is sorted before slicing.
        Slices off less if proportion results in a non-integer slice index (i.e. conservatively slices off 'proportiontocut').

    Parameters
    ----------
    a : array_like
        Input array.
    proportiontocut : float
        Fraction to cut off of both tails of the distribution.
    axis : int, optional
        Axis along which the trimmed means are computed.
        Default is 0.
        If None, compute over the whole array 'a'.

    Returns
    -------
    DataContainer
        type 'ordered pair', 'scalar', or 'matrix'
