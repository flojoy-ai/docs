Apply image smoothing operation on the input `DataContainer` class,
specifically for the 'image' type,
represented by the RGB(A) channels.

Args:
dc_inputs (list[DataContainer]): List of DataContainer objects containing
image channels.
params (dict): Additional parameters for image smoothing.

Params:
kernel: The strength of the smoothing. A large value will lead
to stronger smoothing. smoothing_type: The type of smoothing to use
(https://docs.opencv.org/4.x/d4/d13/tutorial_py_filtering.html).

Returns:
DataContainer: A `DataContainer` class of type 'image' representing the
output image with image smoothing results.

Raises:
Exception: If an error occurs during smoothing.
