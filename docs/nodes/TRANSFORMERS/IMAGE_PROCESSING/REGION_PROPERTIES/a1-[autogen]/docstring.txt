The image processing REGION_PROPERTIES node is a stand-alone visualizer for analyzing
    an input array of data. There are multiple input 'DataContainer' types for which
    this function is applicable: 'Image', 'Grayscale', or 'Matrix'.

    Often in image analysis, it is necessary to determine subvolumes / subregions
    inside a given image, whether for object count (e.g. the counting of
    cells on a glass plate), or object dimensional analysis (determining coutours of
    a region, centroid of a region relative to the pixel coordinate origin of the image,
    determining the semi-major or -minor axes of a region, etc.). This functionality
    is entirely provided by this node in a two-step process:

    - First, the regions of the INTEGER image are identified and labelled.
    - Second, the regions are analysed.

    The first step is provided by the morphology library of scikit-image's label function,
    while the second is provided by scikit-image's regionprops function.

    After processing, the results of this node are visualized in the main UI,
    where the user can see:
    - The input array / image.
    - The semi-major and semi-minor axes of the contour drawn relative to the contour centroid.
    - The contour centroid.
    - The countour bounding-box.
    - A mouse-hover utility that displays the contour information to the user.

    Parameters
    ----------
    default : Image | Grayscale
        The input node to this function.
        If nothing is supplied, a demo test case is returned to illustrate the functionality of this node.

    Returns
    -------
    fig : Plotly
        A Plotly figure containing the illustrated features as determined by this node.
