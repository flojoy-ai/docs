This image processing node is a stand-alone visualizer for analyzing
an input array of data. There are multiple input `DataContainer` types for which
this function is applicable: `Image`, or  `Grayscale`, or `Matrix`.

Often in image analysis, it is necessary to determine subvolumes / subregions
inside a given image, whether this be for object count (e.g. the counting of
cells on a glass plate), object dimensional analysis (determining coutours of
a region, centroid of a region relative to the pixel coordinate origin of the image,
determining the semi-major (-minor) axes of a region, etc.). This functionality
is entirely provided by this node in a two-step process:

    - First, the regions of the INTEGER image are identified and labelled (NOTA BENE
        the integer type requirement)
    - Second, the regions are then analysed.
The first step is provided by the morphology library of scikit-image's label function,
while the second is provided by scikit-image's regionprops function.

After processing, the results of this node are visualized in the main UI,
where the user can see:
    - The input array / image
    - The semi-major and semi-minor axes of the contour drawn relative to the contour centroid
    - The contour centroid
    - The countour bounding-box
    - A mouse-hover utility that displays the contour information to the user for the contour
      above which is the mouse.

Parameters
----------
default     :       Optional[Image | Grayscale],
    The input node to this function. If nothing is supplied, then a demo test
    case is returned to illustrate the functionality of this node.

Returns
-------
fig         :       Plotly
    Returns the Plotly superclass of `DataContainer` that has the illustrated
    features as determined by this node.
