The CHANNEL_SPLIT node returns the rgba channels of an image
    into 4 separate images for direct visualization. While the notion
    of "splitting an image into RGBA channels" is inherently tied to coloured
    pictures, this function will attempt to make sense of multiple input types.

    Should the input be of type 'Image', then the function will return the RGBA channels.
    Should the input be of type 'Matrix', meaning ideally a 3D 'numpy' array
    of size (L, M, 3) or (L, M, 4), then the function will return each channel respectively.


    Returns
    -------
    IMAGE_CHANNEL_OUTPUTS
        The images, each channel itself is rendered with alpha=1, except
        the alpha channel itself.
