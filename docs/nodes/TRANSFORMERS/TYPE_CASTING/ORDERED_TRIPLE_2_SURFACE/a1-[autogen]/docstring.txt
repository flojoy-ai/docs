The ORDERED_TRIPLE_2_SURFACE node takes an "OrderedTriple" instance of the DataContainer class that contains three arrays: x, y, and z.

    It then reshapes the z array into a 2D grid using the unique values of x and y.

    The resulting 2D grid is used to create a Surface object with corresponding x, y, and z values.

    Inputs
    ------
    default : OrderedTriple
        The input OrderedTriple to which we apply the conversion to.

    Returns
    -------
    Surface
        The surface result from the conversion of the input.
