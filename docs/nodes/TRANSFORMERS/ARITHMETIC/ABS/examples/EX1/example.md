description: In this example, the LINSPACE node generates a line of values from "-"10 to 10. Those values are passed to the ABS node, which takes the absolute value of its input. In the end, all the values are converted to positive, and the output is visualized with the SCATTER node.

In this example, the `LINSPACE` node generates a line of values from -10 to 10. 

Those values are passed to the `ABS` node, which takes the absolute value of its input. In the end, all the values are converted to positive, and the output is visualized with the `SCATTER` node.
