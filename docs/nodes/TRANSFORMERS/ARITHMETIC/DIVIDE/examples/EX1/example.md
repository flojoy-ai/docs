description: In this example, we use the DIVIDE node to undo the effects of a SINE node. We first generate two sine functions using the LINSPACE and SINE nodes, and then use the DIVIDE node to cancel them out. This generates a flat scatter plot with the SCATTER node.

In this example, we use the `DIVIDE` node to undo the effects of a `SINE` node. 

We first generate two sine functions using the `LINSPACE` and `SINE` nodes, and then use the `DIVIDE` node to cancel them out. This generates a flat scatter plot with the `SCATTER` node.
