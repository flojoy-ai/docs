The SAVGOL node applies a Savitzky-Golay filter to an input signal. It is generally used for smoothing data.

    The default behaviour is to implement a 3-point moving average of the data.

    Inputs
    ------
    default : OrderedPair
        The data to apply the numpy savgol filter to.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window_length : int
        the length of the filter window, must be less than or equal to the size of the input
    poly_order : int
        the order of the polynomial used to fit the samples, must be less than or equal to the size of window_length

    Returns
    -------
    OrderedPair
        x: time axis
        y: filtered signal
