Apply a Savitzky-Golay filter to an input signal, it's generally used for smoothing data
    The default behaviour is implementing a 3-point moving average of the data.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window_length: int
        the length of the filter window, must be less than or equal to size of the input
    poly_order: int
        the order of the polynomial used to fit the samples, must be less than or equal to size of window_length

    Returns
    -------
    OrderedPair
        x: time axis
        y: filtered signal
