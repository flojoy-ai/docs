In this example, five `BASIC_OSCILLATOR` nodes generate an array of 400 samples with a sample rate of 100. 
Each has a different amplitude and a unique frequency between 10-35hz. They are then all summed together into one signal using the `ADD` node.

To obtain one of the initial sine waves, which is the one generated by `BASIC_OSCILLATOR_3` in this case, the `FIR` node is used to filter out all other frequencies that are not 25hz.

The filter type is set as `bandpass` because there are unwanted frequencies both above and below 25hz.
The high cutoff would be 28hz and the low cutoff would be 23hz. For the window, `barthann` is used for
a sharper cutoff since we do not want any other frequencies in this example. 

For taps, there are a couple of ways to do the calculation, depending on how much attenuation or ripple there is in the signal. Some formulas that can be used, are available [here](https://dsp.stackexchange.com/questions/31066/how-many-taps-does-an-fir-filter-need) (the top-rated answer
was used in this example). With the transition width being 20, the number of taps would be 80 after calculation.

Finally, the output of the `FIR` node is displayed with the `LINE` node, which gives us a very similar graph to that of `BASIC_OSCILLATOR_3`. Also, two `FFT` nodes are included to show the frequencies before and after the `FIR` node.
