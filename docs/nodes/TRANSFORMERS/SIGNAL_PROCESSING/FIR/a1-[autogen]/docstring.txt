Apply a low-pass FIR filter to an input vector. This
    filter takes a few inputs: the sample_rate (will be passed as a parameter
    if the target node is not connected), the desired width of the
    transition to the stop band and the corresponding attentuation, and
    lastly the cutoff frequency.
