The FIR node applies a low-pass FIR filter to an input vector. The filter is designed with the window method.

    This filter takes a few inputs:
    the sample_rate (will be passed as a parameter if the target node is not connected), the window type of the filter, the cutoff frequency, and the number of taps (or length) of the filter.

    Inputs
    ------
    default : OrderedPair
        The data to apply a FIR filter to.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_rate : int
        the amount of samples within a second
    filter_type : select
        how the filter behaves
    window : select
        the window function used in the FIR
    cutoff_low : float
        the frequency cutoff to filter out the lower frequencies
    cutoff_high : float
        the frequency cutoff to filter out the upper frequencies
    taps : int
        the length of the filter

    Returns
    -------
    OrderedPair
        x: time domain
        y: filtered signal
