The FFT node Performs a Discrete Fourier Transform on the input vector.
Through the FFT algorithm, the input vector will be transformed
from the time domain into the frequency domain which will be an ordered pair of arrays.

Parameters
---------
window: Selection of window types
    the node will apply a window to the signal to avoid spectral leakage
real_signal: boolean
    whether the input signal is real or complex
sample_rate: int
    the sample rate of the real signal, if the input is complex, it will default to 1
    regardless of the input

Returns
-------
ordered_pair
    x: frequency
    y: spectrum of the signal
