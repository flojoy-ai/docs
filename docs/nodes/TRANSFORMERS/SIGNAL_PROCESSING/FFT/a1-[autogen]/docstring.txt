The FFT node performs a Discrete Fourier Transform on the input vector.

    Through the FFT algorithm, the input vector will be transformed from a time domain into a frequency domain, which will be an ordered pair of arrays.

    Inputs
    ------
    default : OrderedPair
        The data to apply FFT to.

    Parameters
    ----------
    window : select
        the node will apply a window to the signal to avoid spectral leakage
    real_signal : boolean
        whether the input signal is real or complex
    sample_rate : int
        the sample rate of the signal, defaults to 1
    display : boolean
        whether the output would be graphed, set to false for pure data and true for data that is more suitable to be graphed

    Returns
    -------
    OrderedPair if display is true
        x: frequency
        y: spectrum of the signal
    DataFrame if display is false
        time: time domain
        frequency: frequency domain
        real: real section of the signal
        imag: imaginary section of the signal
