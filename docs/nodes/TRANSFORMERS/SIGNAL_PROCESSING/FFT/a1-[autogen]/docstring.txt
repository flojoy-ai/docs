The FFT node performs a Discrete Fourier Transform on the input vector.
Through the FFT algorithm, the input vector will be transformed
from the time domain into the frequency domain which will be an ordered pair of arrays.

Parameters
---------
window: Selection of window types
    the node will apply a window to the signal to avoid spectral leakage
real_signal: boolean
    whether the input signal is real or complex
sample_rate: int
    the sample rate of the signal, defaults to 1
display: boolean
    whether the output would be graphed, set to false for pure data, true for data that's more suitable to be graphed

Returns
-------
ordered_pair
    x: frequency
    y: spectrum of the signal
