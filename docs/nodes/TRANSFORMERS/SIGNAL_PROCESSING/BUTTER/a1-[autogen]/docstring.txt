    filter_order : int
        The intensity of the filter.
    critical_frequency : int
        The frequency where the filter takes effect. For lowpass and highpass, it takes a scalar.
        For bandpass and bandstop, it takes an array with the length of 2.
    btype : select
        The type of the filter.
    sample_rate : int
        The sample rate of the input signal.

    Returns
