In this example, the `DOUBLE_DEFINITE_INTEGRAL` node generates a `Scalar` type value with the following parameters:

Function: x*y

Upper_bound_x: 2

Lower_bound_x: 0

Upper_bound_y: 1

Lower_bound_y: 0

The value is added with the `SINE` node, which moves up the `sine` function from the scalar that was added. This difference is visible when you compare the results with the two `SCATTER` nodes.
