title: DOUBLE_DEFINITE_INTEGRAL
description: In this example, the DOUBLE_DEFINITE_INTEGRAL node generates a Scalar type value. The value is added with the SINE node, which moves up the sine function from the scalar. This difference is visible when you compare the results with the two SCATTER nodes.

In this example, the `DOUBLE_DEFINITE_INTEGRAL` node generates a `Scalar` type value with the following parameters:

Function: x*y

Upper_bound_x: 2

Lower_bound_x: 0

Upper_bound_y: 1

Lower_bound_y: 0

The value is added with the `SINE` node, which moves up the `sine` function from the scalar that was added. This difference is visible when you compare the results with the two `SCATTER` nodes.
