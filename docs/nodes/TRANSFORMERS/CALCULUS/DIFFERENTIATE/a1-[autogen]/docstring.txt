The DIFFERENTIATE node takes two lists, x and y, as input.

    It then computes the derivative of the array, y, with respect to x.

    Inputs
    ------
    default : OrderedPair|Vector
        Input from which we get the x and y lists use in the derivative.

    Returns
    -------
    OrderedPair
        x: the x-axis of the input.
        y: the result of the derivative.
