The DOUBLE_INDEFINITE_INTEGRAL node takes an OrderedTriple (x,y,z) and have the width and height parameter.

The width and height represent the number of columns and rows, respectively, that the x, y, and z reshape matrices will have. Here it is important to note that the length of x, y, and z is the same and that the width times the height needs to be equal to the length of x, y, and z.

It computes the double integral approximation according to given dimensions of the matrices, and it returns a matrix where each cell represents the volume up to the given point.

Inputs
------
default : OrderedTriple
    Input from which we use x, y and z to compute the integral.

Parameters
----------
width : int
    Number of columns of the 3 matrices generated by reshaping the x, y, and z columns of the OrderedTriple.
height : int
    Number of rows of the 3 matrices generated by reshaping the x, y, and z columns of the OrderedTriple.

Returns
-------
Matrix
    m : matrix that contains the volume up to that point in each cell.
