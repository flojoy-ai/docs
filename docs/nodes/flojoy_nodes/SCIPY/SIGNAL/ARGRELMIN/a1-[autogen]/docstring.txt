The ARGRELMIN node is based on a numpy or scipy function.

The description of that function is as follows:

    Calculate the relative minima of 'data'.

Parameters
----------
data : ndarray
    Array in which to find the relative minima.
axis : int, optional
    Axis over which to select from 'data'. Default is 0.
order : int, optional
    How many points on each side to use for the comparison
    to consider "comparator(n, n+x)" to be True.
mode : str, optional
    How the edges of the vector are treated.
    Available options are 'wrap' (wrap around) or 'clip' (treat overflow
    as the same as the last (or first) element).
    Default 'clip'. See numpy.take.

Returns
-------
DataContainer
    type 'ordered pair', 'scalar', or 'matrix'
