The FIR node Apply a low-pass FIR filter to an input vector.
    The filter is designed with the window method.
    This filter takes a few inputs: the sample_rate (will be passed as a parameter
    if the target node is not connected), the window type of the filter, the cutoff frequency.
    and lastly the number of taps (or length) of the filter.

    Parameters
    ----------
    sample_rate: int
        The amount of samples during a second
    filter_type: select
        How the filter behaves
    window: select
        The window function used in the FIR
    cutoff_low: float
        The frequency cutoff to filter out the lower frequencies
    cutoff_high: float
        The frequency cutoff to filter out the upper frequencies
    taps: int
        The length of the filter

    Returns
    -------
    OrderedPair
        x: time domain
        y: filtered signal
    ------
