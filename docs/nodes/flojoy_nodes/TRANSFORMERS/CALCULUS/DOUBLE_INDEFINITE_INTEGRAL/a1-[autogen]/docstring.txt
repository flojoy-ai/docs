The DOUBLE_INDEFINITE_INTEGRAL node takes an OrderedTriple (x,y,z) and have the width and height parameter.
The width and height respectively represent the number of columns and rows that the x, y and z reshape matrices will have.
Here it's important to note that the length of x, y and z is the same and that the width times the height need to be equal to the length of x, y and z.
It computes the double integral approximation according to the matrices dimensions given and it returns a matrix where each cell represents volume up to the given point.

Parameters
----------
width: int
    Number of columns of the 3 matrices generate by reshaping the x, y and z columns of the OrderedTriple.
height: int
    Number of rows of the 3 matrices generate by reshaping the x, y and z columns of the OrderedTriple.

Returns
-------
m: Matrix
    matrix containing in each cell the volume up to that point.
