ONNX_MODEL loads a serialized ONNX model and uses it to make predictions using ONNX Runtime.

    On the one hand, ONNX is an open format to represent deep learning models.
    ONNX defines a common set of operators - the building blocks of machine learning
    and deep learning models - and a common file format to enable AI developers
    to use models with a variety of frameworks, tools, runtimes, and compilers.

    See: https://onnx.ai/

    On the other hand, ONNX Runtime is a high-performance inference engine for machine
    learning models in the ONNX format. ONNX Runtime has proved to considerably increase
    performance in inferencing for a broad range of ML models and hardware platforms.

    Parameters
    ----------
    file_path : str
        Path to a local ONNX model to load and use for prediction.

    default : Vector
        The input tensor to use for prediction.
        For now, only a single input tensor is supported.
        Note that the input tensor shape is not checked against the model's input shape.

    Returns
    -------
    Vector:
        The predictions made by the ONNX model.
        For now, only a single output tensor is supported.
