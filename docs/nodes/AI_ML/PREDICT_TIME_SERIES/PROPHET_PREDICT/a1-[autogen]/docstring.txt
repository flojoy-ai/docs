The PROPHET_PREDICT node rains a Prophet model on the incoming dataframe.

The DataContainer input type must be a dataframe, and the first column (or index) of dataframe must be of a datetime type.

This node always returns a DataContainer of a dataframe type. It will also always return an "extra" field with a key "prophet" of which the value is the JSONified Prophet model.
This model can be loaded as follows:
    ```python
    from prophet.serialize import model_from_json

    model = model_from_json(dc_inputs.extra["prophet"])
    ```

Parameters
----------
run_forecast : bool
    If True (default case), the dataframe of the returning DataContainer 
    ("m" parameter of the DataContainer) will be the forecasted dataframe.
    It will also have an "extra" field with the key "original", which is
    the original dataframe passed in.

    If False, the returning dataframe will be the original data.

    This node will also always have an "extra" field, run_forecast, which 
    matches that of the parameters passed in. This is for future nodes 
    to know if a forecast has already been run.

    Default = True

periods : int
    The number of periods to predict out. Only used if run_forecast is True.
    Default = 365

Returns
-------
DataFrame
    With parameter as df.
    Indicates either the original df passed in, or the forecasted df
    (depending on if run_forecast is True).

DataContainer
    With parameter as "extra".
    Contains keys run_forecast which correspond to the input parameter,
    and potentially "original" in the event that run_forecast is True.
