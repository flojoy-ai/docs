Trains a Prophet model on the incoming dataframe, optionally running a forecast

    The DataContainer input type must be `dataframe`, and that dataframe must have its
    first column (or index) be of datetime type.

    This node always returns a DataContainer of type 'dataframe'. It will also
    always return an `extra` field with a key `prophet` whose value is the JSONified
    Prophet model, which can be loaded as follows:
        ```python
        from prophet.serialize import model_from_json

        model = model_from_json(dc_inputs.extra["prophet"])
        ```
    If the `run_forecast` param is True (default case), the returning DataContainer
    will have it's dataframe (`m` parameter of the DataContainer) be the forecast
    dataframe. It will also have an `extra` field with the key "original" which is
    the original dataframe.

    If `run_forecast` is false, the returning dataframe will be the original data
