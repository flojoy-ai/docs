The PROPHET_PREDICT node rains a Prophet model on the incoming dataframe

    The DataContainer input type must be `dataframe`, and that dataframe must have its
    first column (or index) be of datetime type.

    This node always returns a DataContainer of type 'dataframe'. It will also
    always return an `extra` field with a key `prophet` whose value is the JSONified
    Prophet model, which can be loaded as follows:
        ```python
        from prophet.serialize import model_from_json

        model = model_from_json(dc_inputs.extra["prophet"])
        ```

    Parameters
    ----------
    run_forecast : bool
        If the True (default case), the returning DataContainer
        will have its dataframe (`m` parameter of the DataContainer) be the forecasted
        dataframe. It will also have an `extra` field with the key "original" which is
        the original dataframe passed in.

        If false, the returning dataframe will be the original data.

        This node will also always have an `extra` field "run_forecast" which matches
        that of the param passed in. This is for future nodes to know if a forecast
        has already been run

        Default True
    periods : int
        The number of periods to predict out. Only used if run_forecast is True.
        Default 365

    Returns
    -------
    DataContainer of type `dataframe` with param `m` which indicates either the original
        df passed in, or the forecasted df (depending on if `run_forecast` is True),
        as well as the `extra` param with keys "run_forecast" which correspond to the
        input param, and potentially "original" in the event that `run_forecast` is True
