In this example, the `tips` dataset from the `PLOTLY_DATASET` node is passed to `ONE_HOT_ENCODING`.

For the `columns` parameter, `smoker,day` is passed to `ONE_HOT_ENCODING` so that the output consists of a dataframe with one hot encodings for only the `smoker` and `day` columns from the input dataset.
