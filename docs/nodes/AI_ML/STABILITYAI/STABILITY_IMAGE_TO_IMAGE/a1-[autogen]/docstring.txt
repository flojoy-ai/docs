This node uses StabilityAI Image-to-Image API to generate an image based on an input image and a text prompt.
The image can be provided as a image file path or as a DataContainer Image object from a previous node.
The previous node value has priority over the file path.

Parameters:
- image_path: string
    Path to the image file to be transcribed. []".jpg", ".jpeg", ".png"] format are supported.
- prompt: string
    Text prompt to be used for image generation.
- width: int
    Width of the generated image.
- height: int
    Height of the generated image.
- cfg_scale: float
    Influences how strongly your generation is guided to match your prompt, 
    higher values means more influence. Defaults to 7.0 if not specified.
