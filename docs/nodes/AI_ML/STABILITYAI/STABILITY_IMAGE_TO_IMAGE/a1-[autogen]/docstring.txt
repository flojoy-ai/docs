The image can be provided as a image file path or as a DataContainer Image object from a previous node.
The previous node value has priority over the file path.

- prompt: string
    Text prompt to be used for image generation.
- width: int
    Width of the generated image.
- height: int
    Height of the generated image.
- cfg_scale: float
    Influences how strongly your generation is guided to match your prompt,
    higher values means more influence. Defaults to 7.0 if not specified.
